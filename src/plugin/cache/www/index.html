    <h1>Cache Plugin</h1>
    The <strong>cache</strong> provides a way to store temporary files
    such as cookies or OAUTH2 tokens.
    <p>
    Multiple caches are supported.
    Each cache can have its own settings, which are persistent and shared
    among processes.
    New caches default settings come from the plugin's settings.

          <td>""</td>
          <td>This is the directory where the cache resides.
              Leaving it set to "" causes the plugin to search through
              the JsonCalc path (<tt>config.path</tt>) for the first writable
              directory, and create a "cache" subdirectory there to store all
              caches.
              Usually this works out to be "~/.config/jsoncalc/cache/".

          <td>600</td>
          <td>How many seconds to retain cached information.
              Anything older than this will be discarded.
              As a special case, setting it to 0 will prevent cached items
              from ever being discarded due to age.

          <td>0</td>
          <td>Approximate number of bytes that each cache is allowed to use.
              If a cache grows larger than this, then older items will be
              deleted to shrink it down.
              As a special case, settings this to 0 will prevent cached items
              from ever being discarded due to the cache's overall disk usage.

              when looking for older cache items to discard,
              the module goes by when the item was added to the cache,
              regardless of how recently the item was retrieved and used
              again.
              Setting this to <tt>true</tt> will change that so the
              <tt>seconds</tt> setting is relative to the last use,
              not when the item was first added to the cache.
