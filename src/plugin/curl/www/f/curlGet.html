      This is part of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?p=curl">curl</a> plugin.
      You must load the plugin via either -lcurl on the shell command line,
      or a <tt>plugin curl;</tt> line in a script.
      This sends a request and returns the response.
      Typically the request URL would be use "http:" or "https:" but
      other protocols such as "sftp:" are supported too.
      <p>
      The <tt>url</tt> argument is required.
      All other arguments are optional, and may be given in any order.
      As luck would have it, each possible argument has a different data type
      so <tt>curlGet()</tt> can figure out which argument is what.
      <p>
      If the <tt>url</tt> is followed by a string or object, it is taken to
      be a query to append to the URL.
      A string will be appended verbatim.
      An object must only have member values that are strings or numbers,
      and they will be converted to a series of name=value pairs as though
      from an HTML form, with URL encoding done automatically.
      For example, <tt>{season:"All Season"}</tt> would append
      "?season=All%20Season" to the URL.
      <p>
      This may be followed by one or more flag arguments.
      The flags are numbers, but there's a <tt>CURL</tt> object which
      defines symbolic names for the numbers, so you'll generally want to use
      <tt>CURL.bearer_</tt> instead of its number (which happens to be 4).
      The underscore at the end of the symbolic name is a clue that this
      flag requires an extra parameter, specifically a bearer token in
      this case.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>curlGet("http://localhost/")</kbd>
	<samp><i>Some big HTML string</i></samp>
        This attempts to fetch the main index of a local HTTP server.
        Assuming you have one running, you should receive an HTML document
        back, as a string.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>const data={size:"L", color:"Brown", odor: "None"};</kbd>
	<kbd>curlGet("https://example.net/app/request.json", data, CURL.username_, "steve", CURL.password_, "haBiBi", CURL.decode)</kbd>
	<samp><i>A bunch of parsed data.</i></samp>
	First we build an object containing data to append to the URL.
	Then we run <tt>curlGet()</tt> passing it the URL, the data, and some
	flags.
	The flags define the user name and password and imply that
	"Authentication: Basic" should be used, and also to decode the response
	text, so we get an object instead of a big string.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>If you pass query data as a string instead of an object, then
            you must ensure that the string is URL-encoded.
            This will probably involve calling <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?f=curl/encodeURIComponent">encodeURIComponent()</a>.

        <li>To avoid having to repeat your login credentials with every request,
            you may need to enable cookies by adding a <tt>CURL.cookies</tt>
            flag.

      </ul>
