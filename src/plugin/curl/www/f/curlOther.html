      This is part of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?p=curl">curl</a> plugin.
      You must load the plugin via either -lcurl on the shell command line,
      or a <tt>plugin curl;</tt> line in a script.
      This sends a request and returns the response.
      Typically the request URL would be use "http:" or "https:" but
      other protocols such as "sftp:" are supported too.
      <p>
      The <tt>verb</tt> and <tt>url</tt> arguments are required.
      All others are optional.
      <p>
      The <tt>verb</tt> would typically be "DELETE" or "HEAD", though HTTP
      does define a few others.
      The use of this for any protocol other than HTTP/HTTPS may be... weird.
      <p>
      If the <tt>url</tt> is followed by a string or object, it is taken to
      be a query to append to the URL, or to send as the request's content
      if you include a <tt>CURL.reqContent</tt> flag.
      A string will be appended verbatim.
      An object without <tt>CURL.reqContent</tt> must only have member values
      that are strings or numbers, and they will be converted to a series of
      name=value pairs as though from an HTML form,
      with URL encoding done automatically.
      For example, <tt>{season:"All Season"}</tt> would append
      "?season=All%20Season" to the URL.
      However, with <tt>CURL.reqContent</tt> the data can be anything.
      <p>
      This may be followed by one or more flag arguments.
      The flags are numbers, but there's a <tt>CURL</tt> object which
      defines symbolic names for the numbers, so you'll generally want to use
      <tt>CURL.bearer_</tt> instead of its number (which happens to be 4).
      The underscore at the end of the symbolic name is a clue that this
      flag requires an extra parameter, specifically a bearer token in
      this case.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>curlOther("DELETE", "http://localhost/event/" + id)</kbd>
	<samp><i>Some big confirmation string</i></samp>
	This sends an HTTP "DELETE" request, to delete an event I guess.
	Often sites that use a "DELETE" request like to embed important
	ID numbers as parts of the URL, instead of in the query or content.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>If you pass query data as a string instead of an object, then
            you must ensure that the string is URL-encoded.
            This will probably involve calling <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?f=curl/encodeURIComponent">encodeURIComponent()</a>.

        <li>To avoid having to repeat your login credentials with every request,
            you may need to enable cookies by adding a <tt>CURL.cookies</tt>
            flag.

      </ul>
