      This is part of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?p=curl">curl</a> plugin.
      You must load the plugin via either -lcurl on the shell command line,
      or a <tt>plugin curl;</tt> line in a script.
      <p>
      The <tt>uuid()</tt> funnction generates a Universally Unique Identifier
      string, consisting of 32 hex digits with some hyphens inserted to divide
      the value into groups of 8-4-4-4-12 digits.
      Many standards use UUIDs to identify documents, records, transactions,
      etc.
      <p>
      The digits are all random.
      If possible, they'll be derived from /dev/random or /dev/urandom.
      If that isn't available, it'll use the <i>lrand48</i>(3) function
      which doesn't really have enough bits to really generate
      32 hex digits (128 bits) randomly.
      <p>
      The full UUID standard specifies multiple ways to generate the
      UUID value (e.g. by deriving some bits from a timestamp or counter
      instead of random), but this <tt>uuid()</tt> function is always random.

      <ul>

        <li>UUIDs are also sometimes refered to as GUIDs ("Globally" instead of
            "Universally") especially in the Microsoft world.

	<li>Most standards say that UUIDs should use lowercase a-f as hex
	    digits, which this <tt>uuid()</tt> function does.  They also say
	    that comparisons should be case-insensitive though, like jx's
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../../../index.html?op=equal">=</a>
	    operator.
