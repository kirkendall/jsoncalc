    <h1>Curl Plugin</h1>
    The <strong>curl</strong> plugin gives access to the "cURL" library
    of network protocols.
    In particular, this provides an easy way to send HTTP/HTTPS requests.
    It can also handle other protocols such as SFTP.
    <p>
    The cURL library is huge, complicated, and powerful.
    JsonCalc's <strong>curl</strong> plugin is small and simple.
    <p>
    The most important features are the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlGet">curlGet()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlPost">curlPost()</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlOther">curlOther()</a>
    functions, which send a request (usually HTTP or HTTPS) and return the
    response.
    They work synchronously, meaning they don't return until the response has
    been fully received.
    <p>
    There are a few other utility functions for doing things like generate
    a UUID string.

    <tt>curlGet()</tt> is passed a URL, optional data to append to the URL,
    and optional flags to control other things like whether the response should
    be decoded to an object.
    For <tt>curlPost()</tt>, the data is mandatory and will be sent as content
    instead of appended to the URL.
    For <tt>curlOther()</tt>, an HTTP request verb such as "DELETE" is passed
    before the URL.

    <h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
    The <strong>curl</strong> plugin doesn't add any commands.

    <h2 id="other">Other Features</h2>
    The <strong>curl</strong> plugin defines a "CURL" object containing
    constants for the flags that can be passed to
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlGet">curlGet()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlPost">curlPost()</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlOther">curlOther()</a>.
    Each flag that you use should be passed
    either as a separate argument to the function,
    or as an element in an array passed to the function.
    If there's a collection of flags that you often pass to multiple
    <tt>curlXXXX()</tt> functions, then it makes sense to store them in an
    array, but if its just a solitary call then passing it as extra arguments
    makes sense.
    <p>
    Symbols with names ending with "_" require extra data provided in the
    next argument or array element.
    For example when passing <tt>CURL.username_</tt>, the
    next argument should be a string containing the user name.
    <p>
    To avoid ambiguity, if you're using an array to pass the flags to
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlGet">curlGet()</a> or
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=curl/curlOther">curlOther()</a>
    and don't want to pass any data,
    then you should pass <tt>null</tt> as the argument between the URL
    and the flags array.
    The <tt>null</tt> will take the place where the data should go, and
    prevent the functions from mistaking the flag list for the data.

          Before sending a request using a bearer token, you need to obtain
          that token by sending a request to a separate authentication server,
          which will probably require a user name and password.
          Token strings are often fairly long, but that shouldn't be a problem.

          (like "GET").
          <strong>You'll probably never need to use this explicitly,</strong>
          since "POST" requests set this by default and no other requests
          normally send content.
          Also, note that there are no other arguments associated with this
          flag, since the associated data is always the argument after the

          <strong>the curl plugin will guess the MIME type</strong>.
          If you do need to specify it though, it'll probably be one of

          "cookiejar" setting to locate the file containing cookies.
          The cURL library knows that cookies are domain-specific, and if a
          cookiejar contains cookies from multiple domains then it will only
          send the appropriate ones.
