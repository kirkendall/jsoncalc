    <h1>CSV Plugin</h1>
    The <strong>csv</strong> plugin allows JsonCalc to read or write files
    in CSV format.
    <p>
    CSV is a plain text data format in which each line contains a single
    row of a table, and the columns are delimited by commas.
    If a value is a string containing characters other than ASCII letters and
    digits, it should be enclosed in quote characters.
    Quoting even allows strings to contain literal newlines.
    If the value contains actual quote characters, they can be represented
    by either a backslash-quote sequence or a quote-quote sequence.
    You can also use backslash-backslash to add a single backslash to the
    value.
    <p>
    Reading CSV data doesn't require any special action.
    If the data looks like CSV instead of JSON, then it'll be parsed by
    the CSV parser instead of the JSON parser.

          <td>This controls whether generated CSV should use backslashes,
              including using backslash-quote for quote characters in string
              values.
              Changing the option to <tt>false</tt> makes it use quote-quote
              for quote characters.

          <td>When generating files, this controls whether newlines are
              indicated by a CR-LF pair or just a Unix-style LF character.
	  </td>

        <tr>
          <td>headless</td>
          <td>boolean</td>
          <td>false</td>
          <td>Usually the first row of a CSV file is column headings,
              providing names for all of the columns so that data parsed in
              following rows can be labeled.
              This is a good thing and you want it.
              <p>
              If you're given data without column headings, then you can still
              read it by setting <tt>headless</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
              Then all rows will be read as data rows, but instead of given
              each cell a name (by making each row an object), it'll just
              read each row as an array of values.
              So you end up with an array of arrays, instead of an array of
              objects.
              <em>This means it isn't a "table" as JsonCalc defines it.</em>
              You'll need to find a way to assign names to the cells,
              converting each row array into a row object.
              <p>
              JsonCalc can also write headless CSV data, but it must be a
              table &mdash; the columns must be assigned names so JsonCalc
              knows it's a table.
              When writing, all the <tt>headless</tt> option does is inhibit
              generation of the column label row.

          <td>emptynull</td>

          <td>false</td>
          <td>When reading files, if a cell is empty it would normally be
              interpreted as an empty string.
              Setting this option cause empty cells to be <tt>null</tt>.
              Note that a cell containing empty quotes would still be an
              empty string though.

          <td>When reading files, if a data row is shorter than the column
              heading row, then setting this option will add the missing
              columns for each row.
              The added columns will be either an empty string or <tt>null</tt>,
              under the control of the <tt>emptynull</tt> option.
              Without this, the missing cells are simply absent from the
              row's object.

    The <strong>csv</strong> plugin doesn't add any commands.

    As mentioned earlier, no special action is necessary when reading CSV.
    If data looks like CSV instead of JSON, then it'll be parsed via the CSV
    parser instead of the JSON parser.
    <p>
    To write CSV data, you need to set the "table" formatting option to "csv".
    When you load this plugin, it adds "csv" to the list of preferred values
    for that option, so just saying <tt>-lcsv -scsv</tt> will load the CSV
    plugin and then use it for output.
    In a script, you could switch to CSV output by giving a <tt>set csv</tt>
    command.
    <p>
    JsonCalc only pays attention to the "table" formatting option when it's
    outputting a table &mdash; a non-empty array of objects.
    If you read headless CSV data, you get an array of arrays, not an array
    of objects, so you can't output headless data until you assign names
    to the columns.
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?op=values">VALUES</a>
    operator is good for that.
    Here's an example of assigning names to columns.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>var rgbn = [[0,0,0,"black"],[255,255,255,"white"],[255,255,0,"yellow"]];</kbd>
      <kbd>var headings = ["red","green","blue","colorname"];</kbd>
      <kbd>var tbl = [rgbn] @@ arraysToObject(headings, this);</kbd>
      <kbd>tbl;</kbd>
      <samp>
        <table>
	  <tr><th>red</th><th>green</th><th>blue</th><th>colorname</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>black</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>255</td><td>255</td><td>255</td><td>white</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>255</td><td>255</td><td>0</td><td>yellow</td></tr>
	</table>
      </samp>
      <kbd>set csv; set plugin.csv.headless;</kbd>
      <kbd>tbl;</kbd>
      <samp>0,0,0,"black"<br/>
255,255,255,"white"<br/>
255,255,0,"yellow"</samp>
      First we assign some sample data to a variable, as an array of arrays.
      Next we assign column headings to another variable.
      Then we use the 
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?op=values">VALUES</a>
      operator to combine them into a table.
      <p>
      Once we've converted the array of row arrays to a table
      (array of objects), we first output it in the usual "grid" format,
      and then select "csv" and CSV's "headless" and output it that way.
    </div>
    <p>
    The above example is only relevant if you're working with headless CSV
    tables.
    As long as the CSV data starts with column headings, the <b>csv</b>
    plugin will read it as a table without any fuss.
