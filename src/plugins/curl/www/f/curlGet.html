      This is part of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?p=curl">curl</a> plugin.
      You must load the plugin via either -lcurl on the shell command line,
      or a <tt>plugin curl;</tt> line in a script.
      This sends a request and returns the response.
      Typically the request URL would be use "http:" or "https:" but
      other protocols such as "sftp:" are supported too.
      <p>
      The <tt>url</tt> argument is required.
      All other arguments are optional, and may be given in any order.
      As luck would have it, each possible argument has a different data type
      so <tt>curlGet()</tt> can figure out which argument is what.
      <p>
      A string or object is taken to be query data.
      If it's a string, it will be appended to the URL with a "?" delimiter.
      If it is an object, then members of the object will provide names and
      values to append, and the values will URL-encoded.
      For example, <tt>{season:"All Season"}</tt> would append
      "?season=All%20Season" to the URL.
      <p>
      An array of strings is taken to be a list of HTTP request headers.
      For example, you might include an ["Accept: application/json"] header
      list to specifically request that the response be encoded in JSON.
      <p>
      The response is normally returned as a string.
      If you add a <tt>true</tt> parameter, then <tt>curlGet()</tt> will
      attempt to decode the response, and return the object (or whatever)
      that the response decodes to.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>curlGet("http://localhost/")</kbd>
	<samp><i>Some big HTML string</i></samp>
        This attempts to fetch the main index of a local HTTP server.
        Assuming you have one running, you should receive an HTML document
        back, as a string.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>const data={size:"L", color:"Brown", odor: "None"};</kbd>
	<kbd>const headers=["Authorization: basic "+mime64(user+":"+pass)];</kbd>
	<kbd>curlGet("https://example.net/app/request.json", data, headers, true)</kbd>
	<samp><i>A bunch of parsed data.</i></samp>
	First we build an object containing data to add to the URL.
	Then we build an <tt>Authorization:</tt> header
	(always as an array of strings, not a single string).
	Then we pass those to <tt>curlGet()</tt>, along with the URL
	and a <tt>true</tt> flag to parse the result.
	The parsed response data is then returned.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>If you pass query data as a string instead of an object, then
            must ensure that the string is URL-encoded.
            This will probably involve calling <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?f=curl/encodeURIComponent">encodeURIComponent()</a>.

        <li>Passing <tt>true</tt> to parse the response also implies that
            the request headers should include an ["Accept: application/json"]
            header line.
            However, if you've loaded another plugin that supports parsing
            other data formats (e.g., the "csv" or "xml" plugins) then those
            will be recognized and parsed too.
