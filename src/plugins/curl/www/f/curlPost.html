      This is part of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../../index.html?p=curl">curl</a> plugin.
      You must load the plugin via either -lcurl on the shell command line,
      or a <tt>plugin curl;</tt> line in a script.
      <p>
      This sends an HTTP or HTTPS "POST" request, and returns the response.
      POST requests differ from GET in that any added data is sent as the
      content of the request, instead of being built into the URL.
      This allows POST requests to sent larger data with a complex structure.
      <p>
      The <tt>url</tt> and <tt>content</tt> arguments are required.
      All other arguments are optional, and may be given in any order.
      As luck would have it, each possible argument has a different data type
      so <tt>curlPost()</tt> can figure out which argument is what.
      <p>
      A string will be interpreted as the MIME type of the content.
      A typical value might be <tt>"application/json"</tt>.
      If you don't specify the content's MIME type, then
      <tt>curlPost()</tt> will try to guess it.
      <p>
      An array of strings is taken to be a list of HTTP request headers.
      For example, you might include an ["Accept: application/json"] header
      list to specifically request that the response be encoded in JSON.
      <p>
      The response is normally returned as a string.
      If you add a <tt>true</tt> parameter, then <tt>curlPost()</tt> will
      attempt to decode the response, and return the object (or whatever)
      that the response decodes to.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>const data={size:"L", color:"Brown", odor: "None"};</kbd>
	<kbd>const headers=["Authorization: basic "+mime64(user+":"+pass)];</kbd>
	<kbd>curlPost("https://example.net/app/request.json", data, headers, true)</kbd>
	<samp><i>A bunch of parsed data.</i></samp>
	First we build an object containing data to send as the request's content.
	Then we build an <tt>Authorization:</tt> header
	(always as an array of strings, not a single string).
	Then we pass those to <tt>curlPost()</tt>, along with the URL
	and a <tt>true</tt> flag to parse the result.
	The parsed response data is then returned.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Passing <tt>true</tt> to parse the response also implies that
            the request headers should include an ["Accept: application/json"]
            header line.
            However, if you've loaded another plugin that supports parsing
            other data formats (e.g., the "csv" or "xml" plugins) then those
            will be recognized and parsed too.

      </ul>
