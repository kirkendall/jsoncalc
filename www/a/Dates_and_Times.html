    Date calculations are inherently messy.
    There's no way around it.
    Days aren't always 24 hours because of Daylight Savings Time.
    Months aren't always 31 days.
    Years aren't always 365 days.
    Time zones.
    Having said that, though, JsonCalc's date and time system is about as
    easy to use as you could hope for.
    It is simple and consistent &mdash; a clean interface to messy data.

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    Dates, times, datetimes, and periods are all represented as strings
    using ISO-8601 notation.
    <table class="referencelist">
      <tr><td>"YYYY-MM-DD"</td><td>Date</td><td>"2025-07-04" is July 4 2025</td></tr>
      <tr><td>"hh:mm:sstz"</td><td>Time</td><td>"12:00:00" is noon in the local timezone<br>"13:30:00Z" is 1:30pm in the UTC time zone</td></tr>
      <tr><td>"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:sstz"</td><td>DateTime</td><td>"2008-12-31T23:57:00" is 3 minutes before New Years Day in the local time zone</td></tr>
      <tr><td>"PnYnMnWnDTnHnMnS"</td><td>Period</td><td>"P3M" is three months.<br/>"PT3M" is three minutes.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    Since they're strings, you can compare them as strings, or use string
    functions such <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=substr">substr()</a>
    to pick them apart, and the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=arithmetic">+</a> operator to assemble them.
    <p>
    But there's so much more!

    <h2>Recognizing Dates and Times</h2>
    There are <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=isDate">isDate()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=isTime">isTime()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=isDateTime">isDateTime()</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=isPeriod">isPeriod()</a>
    functions for testing whether a given string is a properly formatted
    ISO date, time, datetime, or period.
    <p>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=typeOf">typeOf()</a>
    and <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=explain">explain()</a>
    functions can distiguish between ISO date/time/datetime/period strings
    and other strings.
    <p>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=typeOf">typeOf()</a>
    function normally just returns one of the 6 basic JSON data types, but
    if you pass an extra <tt>true</tt> parameter then it gets smarter.
    If given a string that looks like an ISO date, it returns "date".
    For times it returns "time", for datetimes it returns "datetime", and for periods it returns "period".
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>typeOf("2025-01-01")</kbd>
      <samp>"string"</samp>
      <kbd>typeOf("2025-01-01", true)</kbd>
      <samp>"date"</samp>
      This shows that dates are strings, but if you pass an extra
      <tt>true</tt> then JsonCalc can distinguish date strings from other
      strings.
      The same is true for other times, datetimes, and periods.
    </div>
    <p>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=explain">explain()</a>
    function is always sensitive to ISO strings.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>explain([{myDate:"2025-02-14"}])</kbd>
      <samp>
<table>
<tr><th>key</th><th>type</th><th>width</th><th>nullable</th></tr>
<tr><td>myDate</td><td>date</td><td>10</td><td>false</td></tr>
</table>
      </samp>
      The date string is recognized as such.
    </div>

    <h2>Built-In Variables</h2>
    There are some built-in functions for accessing the system clock.
    These are listed below.
    <table class="referencelist">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Example</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
      <tr><td>now</td><td>1735170374</td><td>Current time in Unix <tt>time_t</tt> format</td></tr>
      <tr><td>current_date</td><td>"2024-12-25"</td><td>Current date as an ISO-8601 string</td></tr>
      <tr><td>current_time</td><td>"15:46:14"</td><td>Current time as an ISO-8601 string</td></tr>
      <tr><td>current_datetime</td><td>"2024-12-25T15:46:14"</td><td>Current datetime as an ISO-8601 string</td></tr>
      <tr><td>current_timestamp</td><td>"2024-12-25T23:46:14Z"</td><td>Current datetime as in UTC time zone</td></tr>
      <tr><td>current_tz</td><td>"-08:00"</td><td>Current time zone as a ISO-8601 string</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    The <tt>current_</tt><var>xxxxx</var> variables are mostly meant to mimic
    similarly-named variables in MySQL.
    <p>
    The values of <tt>current_time</tt> and <tt>current_datetime</tt> are in
    the local time zone, and have no explicit time zone appended to them.
    If you need to have the time zone explicitly present, you can append
    the <tt>current_tz</tt> string to them.
    If you live in a region that's subject to Daylight Savings Time/Summer Time,
    then the <tt>current_tz</tt> variable will change appropriately.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>current_datetime + current_tz</kbd>
      <samp>"2024-12-25T15:46:14-08:00"</samp>
      This shows the current datetime with the time zone explicitly appended.
    </div>

    <h2>Arithmetic on dates, times, and periods</h2>
    Normally the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=arithmetic">+ and -</a> operators
    concatenate strings,
    but if those strings look like a date/time/datetime on the left
    and a period on the right,
    then it will add the period to the date/time/datetime, or subtract the
    period from the date/time/datetime, and return the result as a new
    ISO date/time/datetime string.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"2025-02-14" + "P1M"</kbd>
      <samp>"2025-03-14"</samp>
      <kbd>"2025-02-14" - "P2W"</kbd>
      <samp>"2025-01-31"</samp>
      Adding 1 month, and subtracting 2 weeks.
      Note that the second example changed both the month and the day.
    </div>
    <p>
    You can also subtract one date from another, and and get an ISO period
    string as a result.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"2025-02-14" - "2025-01-31"</kbd>
      <samp>"P14D"</samp>
      This reverses the example from the second examle above,
      showing that the difference between the two dates is 14 days.
    </div>

    <h2>date(), time(), datetime(), period()</h2>
    These functions generally return an ISO date, time, datetime, or period
    string.
    In their simplest use, you can use them to convert a datetime to a date,
    for example.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>date("2025-03-30T14:23:14")</kbd>
      <samp>"2025-03-30"</samp>
      Convert a datetime to a date.
    </div>
    <p>
    But they're sort of "Swiss army knife" functions.
    By passing them extra arguments, you can use them to perform other useful
    manipulations.
    Most of the rest of this article is about the may ways you can use
    these functions.

    <h2>Changing Time Zones</h2>
    ISO time and datetime strings can have a time zone appended to them.
    <p>
    If there is no time zone
    (or, looking at it another way, if the time zone is "")
    then the time zone is understood to be the local time zone.
    If your area is subject to Daylight Savings Time/Summer Time, then the
    time zone logic will be aware of this &mdash; for datetime, the date
    portion of the datetime will be used to determine whether DST is in effect,
    and for time strings it will use the current date to make that decision.
    <p>
    The UTC time zone is often used in <span title="Application Programming Interface">API</span>s to represent time in a consistent way.
    This time zone can be represented by a "Z" or "+00:00".
    <p>
    Time Zones east of Greenwich (where UTC is the local time) are represented
    by "+hh:mm" where hh is the number of hours and mm is minutes.  Often the
    minutes will be ":00".
    Time Zones west of Greenwich use "-hh:mm".
    <p>
    You can convert a time or datetime from one timezone to another by passing
    the new time zone to <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=time">time()</a>
    or <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=datetime">datetime()</a> as an
    extra parameter.
    (Every other operation you can do on a time or datetime preserves whatever
    timezone it already has.)
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"14:23:00".time("-05:00")</kbd>
      <samp>"17:23:00-05:00"</samp>
      Convert 14:23 from the implied local time zone
      (which in my case is "-08:00") to the "-05:00" time zone.
      This adds 3 hours.
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"2025-02-14T07:13:00+00:00".datetime("")</kbd>
      <samp>"2025-02-13T23:13:00"</samp>
      Convert a datetime from UTC to the local time zone.
    </div>

    <h2>Access a Single Number</h2>
    You can use the functions to extract or alter a single unit number within the
    date/time/datetime/period.
    The first parameter is the value to be examined or altered, as usual.
    Other parameters are the unit name to be examined, and optionally a new
    number value for that unit.
    <p>
    The unit name is represented by a string and can be one of
    "years", "months", "days", "hours", "minutes", or "seconds"
    and may be abbreviated &mdash; most of them to just the first letter.
    For months use "mo" and for minutes use "mi".
    If you just say "m" then JsonCalc will attempt to guess which of those
    two units you wanted.
    <p>
    Passing just a unit name (without a replacement number value for it)
    will cause the functions to return that unit as a number.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"14:23:00".time("mi")</kbd>
      <samp>23</samp>
      Extract the minute number from a time string.
    </div>
    <p>
    Passing a unit name with a number will change that unit in the
    date/time/datetime/period and return the result.
    The order of these parameters doesn't matter.
    You can pass multple name/value pairs to change multiple units.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"14:23:00".time("h", 12)</kbd>
      <samp>"12:23:00"</samp>
      <kbd>"14:23:00".time(3,"m",17,"s")</kbd>
      <samp>"14:03:17"</samp>
      The first example changes the hour to 12.
      The second example changes the minute and second, and also demonstrates
      that the value can come before the name, if that's more convenient.
    </div>
    <p>
    This trick also works on periods.
    Retrieving a single field from a period is different though because
    all larger unit fields will be folded into the requested one.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>period(3,"days")</kbd>
      <samp>"P3D"</samp>
      <kbd>"PT1H30M".period("mi")</kbd>
      <samp>90</samp>
      The first example generates an ISO period string representing 3 days.
      The second example shows that larger units are folded into the requested
      unit, so we get 90 minutes back instead of 30.
    </div>

    <h2>Splitting Into Objects</h2>
    Dates, times, datetimes, and periods can also be represented by an object
    instead of a string.
    The object has members named <tt>year, month, day, hour, minute</tt> and <tt>second</tt>.
    Some of those fields may be missing, e.g. the time fields for a date.
    Some other fields may be added, such as <tt>tz</tt> for the time zone.
    <p>
    You can pass the objects as the first argument to the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=date">date()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=time">time()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=datetime">datetime()</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=period">period()</a>
    functions, and they'll be used the same as ISO strings.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>{year:2025, month:4, day:15}.date()</kbd>
      <samp>"2025-04-15"</samp>
    </div>
    <p>
    Conversely,
    you can also pass those functions an extra <tt>true</tt> parameter to have
    the value returned as an object instead of a string.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"2025-04-15".date(true)</kbd>
      <samp>{"year":2025,"month":4,"day":15}</samp>
      This splits the date's unit fields out as the members of an object.
    </div>
    <p>
    The main advantage of objects is that it's easy to extract or modify
    the fields.
    The main disadvantages are that they aren't standard like the strings are,
    and that you can't do date arithmetic on them like you can with strings.

    <h2>Using Unix time_t Values</h2>
    If the first parameter to 
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=date">date()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=time">time()</a>, or
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=datetime">datetime()</a>
    is a number, then it will be interpreted as the number of seconds
    since the start of 1970.
    This is the Unix standard <tt>time_t</tt> format,
    and is used for file access timestamps and the like.
    JsonCalc's <tt>now</tt> variable returns a <tt>time_t</tt> value.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>now.date(true)</kbd>
      <samp>{"year":2024,"month":12,"day":25}</samp>
      Interpret the current timestamp as a date, and return it as an object.
    </div>
    <p>
    The functions can also return a <tt>time_t</tt> number, if you also pass
    "time_t" (or abbreviated as "t") to the function.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>"2024-12-25".date("t")</kbd>
      <samp>1735113600</samp>
      Convert a date to a Unix time_t value.
      The conversion is sensitive to your time zone, so your system might
      give a slightly different answer than mine.
    </div>
    <p>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=period">period()</a>
    function treats "time_t" as a synonym for "second".
    Since the <tt>time_t</tt> measures time in seconds, this actually works
    pretty well.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>90.period()</kbd>
      <samp>"PT90S"</samp>
      <kbd>"PT5M".period("t")</kbd>
      <samp>300</samp>
      The first example returns an ISO period string corresponding to 90 seconds.
      Note that it doesn't bother to normalize that out to "PT1M30S".
      The second example converts 5 minutes into the number of seconds.
    </div>

    <h2>Parsing Other Date/Time Formats</h2>
    JsonCalc is case-insensitive when parsing periods.
    The "T" separateing date from time in a datetime can also be lowercase "t".
    <p>
    JsonCalc can also parse RFC 3335 datetimes,
    which look like ISO 8601 datetimes except the "T" is replaced with a space.
    This datetime format is used by MySQL.
    It can also parse RFC 5322 datetimes, which look like "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 18:10:21 -0800" and are used in email headers.
    It can alse parse dates in "MM/DD/YYYY" format, and times with an "AM" or "PM" suffix, both of which are common in the US.
    <p>
    Only the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=date">date()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=time">time()</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=dateTime">dateTime()</a>
    functions support those non-ISO 8601 formats though.
    The testing functions such as
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=isDateTime">isDateTime()</a>
    won't recognize them, and you can't to arithmetic on them like you can
    with ISO 8601 strings.
    So use these functions to convert to ISO 8601, then perform any necessary
    computations on the ISO 8601 strings, and maybe convert them back to
    some other format afterward.

    <h2>Generating Other Date/Time Formats</h2>
    When generating a datetime string, JsonCalc will always use an ISO 8601
    string format by default.
    <p>
    You can generate a string value in a locale-specific format by passing
    the word "locale" (which may be abbreviated to "l") as an extra parameter.
    Alternatively you can also pass any format string compatible with
    the C standard library's <tt>strftime()</tt> function.
    (Run "man 3 strftime" in Linux.)
    If the resulting string is all digits,
    then it will be returned as a number instead of a string.
    For example, "%w" will return the day of the week as the number of days
    since Sunday.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>datetime(now, "locale")</kbd>
      <samp>"Wed 25 Dec 2024 07:56:12 PM PST"</samp>
      Convert the current date and time
      (here given in binary via the <tt>now</tt> variable)
      to a format that somebody thinks is preferred in this locale.
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>date(now, "%w")</kbd>
      <samp>3</samp>
      <kbd>date(now, "%Y.%3j")</kbd>
      <samp>"2024.360"</samp>
      The first example returns the number 3, indicating that today is
      Wednesday.
      The second example uses two <tt>%</tt> tokens to combine the year and
      the julien date (days into the year), with the latter being padded
      to a full 3 digits.
    </div>
    <p>
    If you need something else, you can convert the datetime to an object and
    then access the individual unit members.
