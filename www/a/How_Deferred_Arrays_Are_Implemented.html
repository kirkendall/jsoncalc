      This article is for people who want to implement a new type of deferred
      array, or simply use potentially-deferred arrays in their C code.
      Deferred arrays are like normal arrays in many ways, and there are
      library functions for handling arrays in general which hide most of
      added complexity for typical use.
      Case studies of specific types of deferred arrays are presented.

    Deferred arrays are arrays whose elements don't all reside in memory at
    the same time.
    They offer a way to process extremely large JSON files, or in some
    special cases where large data could be generated from smaller data
    such as a <tt>1 ... 1000000</tt> integer array generator.
    <p>
    This article describes the challenges to implementing deferred arrays,
    and the solutions used.
    <p>
    Most people can ignore this, since deferred arrays are intended to act
    as much like normal on-memory arrays as possible.
    The information here might be useful if you're implementing a plugin
    to access a database, and want tables to be represented by deferred arrays.

    <h2>"Normal" Arrays</h2>
    Non-deferred arrays are represented by linked lists of
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=The_json_t_Structure">json_t</a>
    nodes.
    There's a <tt>json_t</tt> with <tt>-&gt;type=JSON_ARRAY</tt>, and its
    <tt>-&gt;first</tt> points to the first element.
    To step from one element to the next,
    follow the element's <tt>-&gt;next</tt> pointer.
    To iterate over a non-deferred array, you can...
    <pre>		
	<i>/* This only works for non-deferred arrays! */</i>
	<b>json_t</b> *array = json_parse("[1,true,\"hello\"]");
	<b>json_t</b> *element;
	<b>for</b> (element = array->first; element; element = element->next) {
	    <i>/* do something with element here */</i>
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Quick and easy!
    We want something similar for deferred arrays.

    <h2>The Basics of Deferred Arrays</h2>

    Deferred arrays are also represented by a <tt>json_t</tt> with
    <tt>-&gt;type=JSON_ARRAY</tt>, but instead of having <tt>-&gt;first</tt>
    point to the <tt>json_t</tt> of the first element, it points to a
    <tt>JSON_DEFER</tt>.
    In other words, for any deferred array, its
    <tt>-&gt;first-&gt;->type=JSON_DEFER</tt>.
    <p>
    Internally, though, there's some funny business going on.
    Instead of pointing to a real <tt>json_t</tt>, it actually points to a
    <tt>jsondef_t</tt>.
    <tt>jsondef_t</tt> is a struct which starts in which the first member
    is a <tt>json_t</tt>, but there are other members tacked on too.
    There's a <tt>fns</tt> member which points to a collection of function
    pointers that implement this particular deferred array's behavior, and
    a <tt>file</tt> member which points to the file that deferred data is
    being read from (if any).
    If a other storage is needed, then yet another layer of type-spoofing
    may be present to add that storage.
    <p>
    Still, since it starts with <tt>json_t</tt> data, the <tt>-&gt;type</tt>
    field is valid, and will always be <tt>JSON_DEFER</tt>.
    <p>
    The collection of function pointers includes one for finding the first
    element, or for the next element, and possibly some others for optimizing
    things like finding the <var>n'th</var> element.

    <h2>json_is_deferred_array() and json_is_deferred_element()</h2>

    If a non-deferred array happens to be empty then the above test would be
    dangerous since it'd involve dereferencing NULL.
    The <tt>json_is_deferred_array()</tt> function does the test in a safe way.
    It's also less cryptic.
    However, the design of deferred arrays is intended to allow the same code
    to work on normal and deferred arrays with (almost) equal ease, so you
    rarely need to know this.
    <p>
    Similarly, json_is_deferred_element() tests whether an element was read
    from a deferred array.
    This can be significant because when you step from one element to the next,
    then the old element is freed.
    If you need to save an element's value, or even just part of its value,
    then you need to copy it using <tt>json_copy()</tt>.

    <h2>json_first() and json_next()</h2>

    The <tt>json_first(</tt><var>array</var><tt>)</tt>
    and <tt>json_next(</tt><var>element</var><tt>)</tt> functions are used for
    iterating over the elements of an array.
    They work for both "normal" and deferred arrays.
    For "normal" arrays they use <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;first</tt>
    and <var>element</var><tt>-&gt;next</tt>, just like the above loop.
    <p>
    But for deferred arrays, json_first() invokes the deferred array's
    function for finding the first element (which could return NULL if the
    deferred array turns out to be empty).
    The first element's <tt>-&gt;next</tt> pointer will point to a
    <strong>copy</strong> of the array's <tt>-&gt;first</tt> data describing
    the deferred array, to facilitate stepping to the next element,
    along with any other data necessary for scanning the array.
    <p>
    Similarly, for elements from a deferred array, the json_next() function
    will invoke the array's function for finding the next element.
    It frees the old element, reuses the <tt>jsondef_t</tt> data as the
    next element's <tt>-&gt;next</tt> pointer value.
    If there is no next element, then it will free the <tt>jsondef_t</tt>
    and any other resources involved in the scan, and return NULL.
    <p>
    This means no extra cleanup is required if your loop always continues
    until <tt>json_next()</tt> returns NULL.

    <pre>		
	<i>/* This works for any array */</i>
	<b>json_t</b> *array = json_parse("[1,true,\"hello\"]");
	<b>json_t</b> *element;
	<b>for</b> (element = json_first(array; element; element = json_next(element)) {
	    <i>/* do something with element here */</i>
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    One big "gotcha!" is that since <tt>json_next()</tt> frees the current
    element before moving onto the, you can't save a pointer to it, or any
    other <tt>json_t</tt> node within the element.
    If you need to save an element, or part of an element, that is scanned
    this way then you need to make a copy of it via <tt>json_copy()</tt>.
    You can use the <tt>json_is_deferred_element()</tt> function to decide
    wither copying is necessary... or just always copy.
    <p>
    Another thing to watch out for is that if you have nested arrays and
    the outer is deferred but the inner one isn't, then applying
    <tt>json_is_deferred_element()</tt> on the inner array's element will
    return <tt>false</tt>, but when <tt>json_next()</tt> is called on the
    outer array's element, then inner element will be automatically freed
    because it was  part of the outer element.

    <h2>json_break()</h2>

    If your array scanning loop exits before <tt>json_next()</tt> returns NULL,
    then you need to call <tt>json_break()</tt> to free the last element and
    all data that was allocated to support the scan.
    <p>
    For simplicity's sake, if you can json_break() with an element that didn't
    come from a deferred array, or for a NULL pointer, then it does nothing.
    You can safely call <tt>json_break()</tt> after breaking out of any
    array-scanning loop.

    <h2>Effects on json_by_index(), json_by_key_value(), and json_by_expr()</h2>

    You need to call <tt>json_break()</tt> on the value returned by any of
    these functions.
    <p>
    The <tt>json_by_index()</tt> and <tt>json_by_key_value()</tt> functions
    use <tt>json_first()/json_next()</tt> to loop over the array, and return
    the requested element.
    This is exactly the kind of thing that <tt>json_break()</tt> is meant to
    clean up for deferred arrays.
    <p>
    The situation with json_by_expr() is more complex.
    It can involve finding an element of an array, and that array could be
    deferred, but the returned value isn't necessarily the whole element.
    For example...
    <pre>
	json_t *result = json_by_expr(data, "address[0].zipcode", NULL);
    </pre>
    ... will look for "address" in data, element 0 from the address array,
    and then "zipcode" in that element.
    If "address" is a deferred array then "address[0]" will be a deferred
    element but "address[0].zipcode" is not.
    So <tt>json_by_expr()</tt> shuffles things around to make
    "address[0].zipcode" look like an element of that same deferred array.
    Kind of wacky, but necessary to avoid leaking the memory used to keep
    track of that deferred array scan.

    <h2>Effects on json_length() and json_is_table()</h2>

    The <tt>json_length()</tt> and <tt>json_is_table()</tt> functions
    work for both normal and deferred arrays.
    <p>
    The <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;text</tt> member is abused for the sake
    of efficiency.
    Instead of requiring an array to be scanned completely to determine its
    length, or whether it is a table, that data is rammed into the
    <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;text</tt> field.
    This is true for both normal and deferred arrays, but it is especially
    helpful for deferred arrays because scanning them could involve a lot
    or parsing or I/O.
    <p>
    The <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;text[1]</tt> character is used to store a
    table flag.
    This is 't' if the array is a table, 'n' if it is not a table, or
    anything else (usually '\0') if unknown.
    For unknown, we do indeed to scan the whole array.
    <p>
    The length is stored in <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;text[2]</tt> through
    <tt>[5]</tt>.
    There's a <tt>JSON_ARRAY_LENGTH(</tt><var>array</var><tt>)</tt> macro
    for accessing those four bytes as an unsigned integer.
    If the length is unknown then
    <tt>JSON_ARRAY_LENGTH(</tt><var>array</var><tt>)</tt> will be 0.
    If the length of a normal array is 0, then its <tt>-&gt;first</tt>
    pointer will be NULL so the length can be counted instantly.
    For deferred arrays, this could get slow... but all of the current
    types of deferred arrays avoid creating an empty deferred array, and
    try hard to set the <tt>JSON_ARRAY_LENGTH(</tt><var>array</var><tt>)</tt>
    to the proper value to avoid forcing a scan for <tt>json_length()</tt>.

    <h2>Effects on json_is_last()</h2>

    The <tt>json_is_last()</tt> function detects whether a given element is
    the last element; i.e. whether <tt>json_last<tt> will return NULL.
    Usually you don't need to know this, but every so often you do.
    For example, if you're generating a text form of the array and don't
    want an extra comma after the last element.
    <p>
    For non-deferred arrays this is easy.
    The last element is the one where <tt>-&gt;next</tt> is NULL.
    For deferred arrays, that doesn't work but there are three other good
    techniques that do, and <tt>json_is_last()</tt> knows them.
    <ol>
      <li>Keep track of the index number for each element as it is returned by
          <tt>json_first()</tt> or <tt>json_next()</tt>.
          If it's one less than the array length, then that's the last one.
          This only works if the array length is known.
      <li>One of the function pointers in <tt>jsondeffns_t</tt> is
          <tt>islast<tt>.
          Not all types of deferred arrays define that function, but if they
          do then that's the solution.
      <li>Start a copy of the scan, and try <tt>json_next()</tt> on the copy.
          If it returns NULL then the actual scan element is the last.
    </ol>
    <p>
    Honestly none of those three "good" ways are perfect though.

    <h2>Nested Arrays</h2>

    The JSON parser only considers deferring an array if it isn't nested
    inside another array.
    So for parsed data, an outer array may be deferred but any inner arrays
    will be entirely in memory.
    <p>
    Even so, it is possible to generate a <tt>json_t</tt> tree that has
    nested deferred arrays.
    It's best to assume that any array could be nested unless you know
    exactly where the data comes from, and can trust it to only generate
    in-memory arrays.
    <p>
    One insidious problem is that when you're scanning nested arrays, even
    if the inner array is not deferred (and hence its elements are not
    from 


    <h2>The ... Operator</h2>

    JsonCalc's <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=ellipsis">...</a>
    operator returns a deferred array of integers between two numbers.
    It's just about the simplest case, so lets look at it in detail.
    It's implemented in the <tt>defer.c</tt> file.
    <p>
    The <tt>json_defer_ellipsis()</tt> function creates the deferred array.
    It starts by calling the usual <tt>json_array()</tt> to allocate an array;
    if the endpoint is smaller than the start, then it returns the empty
    array, no deferring needed.
    <p>
    Otherwise, though, it converts the empty array into a deferred array
    by allocating an instance of a private <tt>jell_t</tt> data type,
    which is a struct that starts with a <tt>jsondef_t</tt>.
    All fields are initialized as needed, including
    <var>jell</var><tt>-&gt;basic-&gt;json-&gt;type = JSON_DEFER</tt>,
    <var>jell</var><tt>-&gt;basic-&gt;fns = &amp;jell_fns</tt>,
    <var>jell</var><tt>-&gt;from = from</tt>, and
    <var>jell</var><tt>-&gt;to = to</tt>.
    <p>
    The <tt>jell_fns</tt> struct
    (which <var>jell</var><tt>-&gt;basic-&gt;fns</tt> points to)
    contains function pointers to private <tt>jell_first()</tt> and
    <tt>jell_next()</tt> functions.
    Those functions return a <tt>json_t</tt> for each successive integer,
    with the <tt>-&gt;next</tt> pointing to a copy of the array's
    <tt>-&gt;first<tt>.
    <p>
    It also defines <tt>jell_islast()</tt> and <tt>jell_byindex</tt> functions.
    It does <strong>not</strong> define a function for doing extra freeing
    because none is needed; that's mostly for things like database access
    where you need to free the result set when you're done with it.
    It also does <strong>not</strong> define a function for searching by a
    key and value because integers aren't objects and hence have no keys.

    <h2>Parsing Large JSON Files</h2>

    I haven't done this yet.  Soon!

<h2>Where Deferred Arrays Can't Happen</h2>
    The <tt>json_first()</tt>/<tt>json_next()</tt> functions are used throughout
    jsoncalc, with one big exception:
    In the <tt>calcfunc.c</tt> file, which implements the built-in functions,
    arrays are used to store the function arguments.
    These are generated internally and are never deferred, so functions
    can use <tt>-&gt;first</tt> and <tt>-&gt;next</tt> safely.
    They often do a lot of validation of their arguments, so this is convenient.
    I've tried to mark most such instances (at least for <tt>-&gt;next</tt>)
    with a <i>/* non-deferred */</i> comment.
    <p>
    Another thing to consider is that objects also use linked lists to store
    their members, and they certainly aren't deferred arrays.
    You can still see many <tt>-&gt;first</tt>/<tt>-&gt;next</tt> loops over
    object members in the library code.
    I've tried to mark them all with a <i>/* object */</i> comment.
