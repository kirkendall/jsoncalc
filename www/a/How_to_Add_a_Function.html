      Adding C functions to JsonCalc is fairly easy.
      Most plugins do it.
      When used in a JsonCalc expression, the arguments are collected into
      an array which is passed to the C function as a single argument.
      The arguments are automatically freed.
      The return value can't directly use any data from the arguments,
      but it can use copies.
      Functions must be registered with the JsonCalc library before they can
      be used in JsonCalc expressions.
      Aggregate functions can also be implemented.
      Resources used in the aggregate data can be automatically freed.

    This article describes how to add a function, written in C.
    We'll start with a simple function, and then move on to aggregate functions.
    If you're only interested in using JsonCalc's expressions and script
    language, not extending it, then you can skip this article.
    <p>
    You'll see the <tt>json_t</tt> data type used a lot in this article.
    It's used to represent JSON values, including just about all data in
    a JsonCalc script.
    See the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=The_json_t_Structure">The json_t Structure</a>
    for more info, if you're curious.

    <h2>Behavior of a function</h2>

    Each function is passed an array of arguments
    (as a <tt>json_t</tt> with -&gt;type=JSON_ARRAY), and returns
    a <tt>json_t</tt> result.
    Here's a quick example:
    <pre>
	json_t *jfn_hrule(json_t *<var>args</var>, <b>void</b> *<var>agdata</var>)
	{
		<b>int</b>	<var>length</var>, <var>i</var>;
		json_t	*<var>result</var>;

		/* Check arguments */
		<b>if</b> (<var>args-&gt;first-&gt;type</var> != JSON_NUMBER
		 || (<var>length</var> = json_int(<var>args-&gt;first</var>)) < 0
		 || <var>args-&gt;first-&gt;next</var> != NULL)
			<b>return</b> json_error_null(0, "The \"%s\" function takes non-negative number", "hrule");

		/* Allocate a json_t string as the result */
		<var>result</var> = json_string("", <var>length</var>);

		/* Fill it with hyphens */
		<b>for</b> (<var>i</var> = 0; <var>i</var> &lt; <var>length</var>; <var>i</var>++)
			<var>result-&gt;text[i]</var> = '-';

		/* Return it */
		<b>return</b> result;
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    The <var>agdata</var> parameter is there mostly for the benefit of aggregate
    functions, described later in this article.
    Most normal (non-aggregate) functions can ignore it but you should
    still declare it to avoid compiler warnings.
    <blockquote>
    I'm not sure I should say this since it's likely to change in the future,
    but for now if your function uses a
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?lit=regex">regular expression</a>
    as an argument, then the <var>args</var> array will have a <tt>null</tt>
    where the regular expression was passed, and the actual <tt>regex_t</tt>
    (see "<tt>man 3 regex</tt>" in Linux) will be passed as the
    <var>agdata</var>.
    Otherwise <var>agdata</var> can be a pointer to the current
    <tt>json_context_t</tt>.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Accessing parameters</h2>
    The <var>args</var> parameter is a <tt>json_t</tt> array.
    You can assume it will never be a deferred array.
    This means you can use <tt>args-&gt;first</tt> to find the first argument,
    <tt>args-&gt;first-&gt;next</tt> for the second, and so on.
    <p>
    The whole <var>args</var> array will be freed by the JsonCalc library
    after your function returns.
    There are two consequences to this:
    <ul>
      <li>You don't need to free the arguments when you're done.
          That happens automatically.
      <li>The value that your function returns can't include any part of the
          <var>args</var> <tt>json_t</tt> tree directly.
          (This is discussed a bit more in the next section.)
    </ul>
    You should always check the types of arguments.
    Start by checking the <tt>-&gt;type</tt> field against the basic JSON
    types such as JSON_STRING or JSON_NUMBER.
    If you need more detailed constraints than that, do it.
    The example at the top of this article checks to make sure the first
    argument is a JSON_NULBER, that it isn't negative, and that no other
    arguments were passed.
    <p>
    Each built-in function is always passed at least one argument.
    If the expression that invokes it doesn't explicitly pass an argument,
    then <tt>true</tt> will be assumed.
    Thus, you can assume <tt>args-&gt;first</tt> is never NULL.

    <h2>Returning a value</h2>
    Each function returns a <tt>json_t</tt> value.
    <p>
    The value should be freshly allocated.
    You <em>cannot</em> reuse parts of the arguments in your return value,
    because the arguments are automatically freed after the function returns.
    If you want to use part of the arguments in your response, use a copy
    instead, e.g. by <tt>json_copy()</tt>.
    <p>
    Simple data types are easy to return, because there are functions to
    do exactly that:
    <table>
      <tr><th>Type</th><th>Function</th><th>Example<th></tr>
      <tr><td>int</td><td>json_from_int(i)</td><td><b>return</b> json_from_int(12);</td></tr>
      <tr><td>double</td><td>json_from_double(d)</td><td><b>return</b> json_from_double(12.3);</td></tr>
      <tr><td>string</td><td>json_string(s,len)</td><td><b>return</b> json_string("Steve",-1);</td></tr>
      <tr><td>boolean</td><td>json_bool(b)</td><td><b>return</b> json_bool(1);</td></tr>
      <tr><td>null</td><td>json_null()</td><td><b>return</b> json_null();</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    I don't want to get too deep into creation of arrays and objects,
    but briefly:
    Use <tt>json_array()</tt> or <tt>json_object()</tt> to allocate an empty
    array or object, and then use <tt>json_append(container, data)</tt> to
    add data to it.
    For objects, the data that you add must be allocated via
    <tt>json_key(key,value)</tt> where <var>key</var> is a simple C string,
    and <var>value</var> is a <tt>json_t</tt>.
    <pre>
	json_t *<var>array</var> = json_array();
	json_append(<var>array</var>, json_from_int(1));
	json_append(<var>array</var>, json_from_double(1.5));
	json_append(<var>array</var>, json_string("Hello World", -1));

	json_t *<var>object</var> = json_<var>object</var>();
	json_append(<var>object</var>, json_key("sample", <var>array</var>));

	<em>/* The leaves object = {"sample":[1,1.5,"Hello World"]} */</em>
    </pre>

    <h2>Returning an error</h2>
    To return an error, use the
    <tt>json_error_null(</tt><var>code</var>, <var>format</var>, ...)</tt>
    function.
    <p>
    The <var>code</var> argument is the internal identifier for that type of
    error.
    I suggest you just pass 0 there, at least at first.
    Later, if you find that your potential errors are very similar those used
    elsewhere in JsonCalc, then you can use the same <var>code</var> and
    <var>format</var> here too.
    The main advantage of passing a non-0 <var>code</var> is that it may allow
    the <var>format</var> to be translated to the locale's language.
    <p>
    On a related note, anything that you don't want translated, such as the
    function name "hrule" in the example above, should probably not be part
    of the error message format string.
    Instead, it should be a separate argument, with a "%s" in the message format
    to say where the untranslated text belongs.
    <p>
    The <var>format</var> string is a printf-style format string, meaning
    %s gets replaced by a string parameter, %d by an int, and so on.
    It serves two purposes:
    to provide a default text message in case no translation is available, and
    to specify the quantity and types of any extra parameters.

    <h2>Registering the function</h2>

    Once your C function is written and compiled (probably in a plugin),
    it must be registered to make JsonCalc aware of it.
    Functions are registered via the <tt>json_calc_function_hook()</tt>
    function.
    This is passed the function name, a string describing the parameters,
    a string describing the return type, and a pointer to the C function.
    The parameter and return type strings should ideally resemble TypeScript
    declarations, though they're basically just comments so it isn't critical.
    <pre>
	json_calc_function_hook("hrule", "width:number", "string", jfn_hrule);
    </pre>

    <h2>Aggregate functions</h2>

    Aggregate functions accumulate results across multiple elements of an array,
    and return a single result.
    Examples are the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=avg">avg()</a>
    and <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=count">count()</a> functions.
    <p>
    In JsonCalc, an aggregate function is implemented as a pair of C functions:
    One to do the aggregation, and one to return the final result.
    For example, the aggregation half of the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=avg">avg()</a>
    function counts of the items seen, and the sum of their values.
    The result half would return <tt>null</tt> if the final count was 0,
    or compute the average and return that if the count was non-zero.
    <p>
    Aggregate functions invariably need a bit of persistent storage space.
    For example, the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=avg">avg()</a>
    function needs to store the count and sum.
    The JsonCalc library allocates space, initializes it to all-zeroes before
    the first call, and then passes a pointer into the functions via the
    <var>agdata</var> parameter.
    It's passed as a <tt>(void*)</tt> but functions can cast it to a pointer to
    whatever data type they actually need.
    <p>
    Registering an aggregate function is a lot like registering a "normal"
    function, except that we need extra arguments for the aggregator function
    pointer, the size of the aggregate data required, and flags to optionally
    request automatic freeing of allocated resources.
    <p>
    Here's an example that defines a <tt>widest()</tt> aggregate function
    which returns the widest string value.

    <pre>
	<em>/* Define a type for storing the aggregate data we need */</em>
	<b>typedef</b> <b>struct</b> {
	    json_t	*<var>str</var>;
	    <b>int</b>		<var>width</var>;
	} agwidest_t;

	<b>void</b> jag_widest(json_t *<var>args</var>, <b>void</b> *<var>agdata)
	{
		agwidest_t</var> *ag = (agwidest_t *)<var>agdata</var>;
		<b>int</b>	<var>width</var>;

		<em>/* Ignore non-strings.  We could convert non-strings to strings</em>
		<em> * via json_serialize() but I'm trying to keep this simple.</em>
		<em> */</em>
		<b>if</b> (<var>args-&gt;first-&gt;type</var> != JSON_STRING)
			<b>return</b>;

		<em>/* Find the width of this string */</em>
		<var>width</var> = json_mbs_width(<var>args->first->text</var>);

		<em>/* If longest so far, remember it.  If some other was being</em>
		<em> * saved before, then free it now.</em>
		<em> */</em>
		<b>if</b> (!<var>ag-&gt;str</var> || <var>width</var> &gt; <var>ag-&gt;width</var>) {
			<b>if</b> (<var>ag-&gt;str</var>)
			      json_free(<var>ag-&gt;str</var>);
			<var>ag-&gt;str</var> = json_copy(<var>args-&gt;first</var>);
			<var>ag-&gt;width</var> = <var>width</var>;
		}
	}

	json_t jfn_widest(json_t *<var>args</var>, <b>void</b> *<var>agdata</var>)
	{
		agwidest_t *<var>ag</var> = (agwidest_t *)<var>agdata</var>;
		json_t	*<var>result</var>;

		<em>/* If no strings were ever seen, return null */</em>
		if (!<var>ag-&gt;str</var>)
			<b>return</b> json_null();

		<em>/* Return the widest string.  Clobber the value in agdata</em>
		 * so it isn't freed right away.
		 */
		<var>result</var> = <var>ag-&gt;str</var>;
		<var>ag-&gt;str</var> = NULL;
		<b>return</b> <var>result</var>;
	}

	<em>/* ... and later, in some initialization code somewhere */</em>
	json_calc_aggregate_hook(
		"widest",		<em>/* name of the function in JsonCalc expressions */</em>
		"s:str",		<em>/* arguments -- a single string each time */</em>
		"str",			<em>/* return type is also a string */</em>
		jfn_widest,		<em>/* the function that returns the final value */</em>
		jag_widest,		<em>/* the function that finds the widest-so-far */</em>
		<b>sizeof</b>(agwidest_t),	<em>/* amount of storage space needed. */</em>
		JSONFUNC_JSONFREE);	<em>/* automatically free the json_t in agwidest_t */</em>
    </pre>
    It could be used like this:
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>["one","two","three","four"] @ widest(this)</kbd>
      <samp>"three"</samp>
      The widest string in the array is "three".
    </div>
    <h3>Automatically freeing aggregate data</h3>
    The bit about automatically freeing resources in the <var>agdata</var>
    requires a bit more discussion.
    <p>
    There are two flags you can pass to <tt>json_calc_aggregate_hook()</tt>
    for the final parameter: JSONFUNC_FREE and JSONFUNC_JSONFREE.
    For JSONFUNC_FREE, the first bytes of the <var>agdata</var> are assumed
    to be a pointer to memory that was allocated via <tt>malloc()</tt> or
    its friends; when the <var>agdata</var> is no longer needed, if those
    bytes represent a non-NULL pointer then <tt>free()</tt> will automatically
    be called on that pointer, to free whatever it was pointing to.
    The JSONFUNC_JSONFREE flag does the same, but assumes it is a <tt>json_t</tt>
    pointer which must be freed via <tt>json_free()</tt>.
    If you use both flags together (via the bitwise-OR operator, |),
    then JsonCalc assumes the <var>agdata</var> starts with a pointer to
    call <tt>free()</tt> on followed by a pointer to call <tt>json_free()</tt>
    on.
    The example above uses JSONFUNC_JSONFREE because the first field in the
    <tt>agwidest_t</tt> data type is a <tt>json_t</tt> pointer.
    <p>
    Automatic freeing isn't just convenient; it's <em>necessary</em>.
    The final value function (<tt>jfn_widest()</tt> in the above example)
    can't be depended on to free it, because that function might never be
    called, depending on the JsonCalc expression it's used in.
    <p>
    The <tt>jfn_widest()</tt> function returns the longest string.
    It <em>could have</em> returned a <tt>json_copy()</tt> copy of the
    string and then allowed JSONFUNC_JSONFREE to free the copy in the
    <var>agdata</var>, but it's more efficient to just return it directly
    and set the pointer in the <var>agdata</var> to NULL to prevent
    JSONFUNC_JSONFREE from freeing it.

    <h2>Adding a function in src/lib/calcfunc.c</h2>

    The built-in functions are all implemented in exactly the same manner
    as described above, with one difference:
    Instead of registering them via <tt>json_calc_function_hook()</tt> or
    <tt>json_calc_aggregate_hook()</tt>, they're directly added to the
    internal linked-list of functions, via a series of initialized variables.
    It looks clunky, but it allows us to avoid having something like a
    <tt>json_init()</tt>.
    There is no <tt>json_init()</tt> function because it isn't needed.
