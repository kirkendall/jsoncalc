    </center>

    This article explains how to write your own plugins.
    <p>
    The source code for plugins resides in the <tt>src/plugins</tt> directory.
    Each plugin gets its own subdirectory below that.
    So choose a name for your plugin, and create a directory with that name.
    I suggest you start by copying the math plugin's directory to your own
    plugin's directory.
    The math plugin is a good starting point because it is very simple.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>cp src/plugins/math/ src/plugins/myplugin</kbd>
    </div>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    Your plugin's *.c source file will need to include the <json.h> file
    so it can access JsonCalc's data types and functions.
    Some of the functions declared there use (FILE*), you'll also need
    to include <stdio.h>.
    You'll almost certainly need to include other headers too, but those
    two are the minimum.
    If your plugin uses multiple *.c files, then all of them will need
    at least those two.
    <p>
    The other mandatory feature of any plugin is that it must define an
    <tt>init()</tt> function.
    This is called when the plugin is first loaded, and it is responsible
    for doing any initialization such as registering new functions or
    commands with JsonCalc.
    It has no parameters.
    This function should return NULL on success, or an error message on failure.
    <p>
    The absolute minimum plugin, therefore, looks like this:
    <pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;json.h&gt;

	<b>char</b> *init(<b>void</b>)
	{
	    <b>return</b> "Hello, world!  I am a plugin.";
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    If your plugin uses options (either from the config file, or appended
    to the <tt>-lmyplugin</tt> command-line option),
    be aware that <em>options haven't been loaded yet</em> when the
    <tt>init()</tt> function is called.
    <p>
    Each plugin has its own independent namespace.
    Names that you give your functions or variables will never clash with
    names used in other plugins, so you shouldn't feel obligated to add a
    "myplugin_" prefix to every global function name; it just isn't necessary.
    For example, the <tt>init()</tt> function in your plugin will not
    cause a name clash with any other plugin's <tt>init()</tt> function.

    <h2>Config Settings</h2>
    When <tt>init()</tt> is called,
    JsonCalc's <tt>json_config</tt> variable has been initialized to contain
    the library's own configuration settings, but their final values have not been
    reloaded from the config file or command-line options yet.
    Your <tt>init()</tt> function should take this opportunity to add its own
    configuration options under "plugin.<var>MYPLUGIN</var>".
    <pre>
	<b>char</b> *screamer_settings = "{"
	    "\"loudest\":88,"
	    "\"quietest\":24,"
	    "\"start-list\":[\"Ya\",\"Wha\",\"Who\",\"K\"],"
	    "\"start\":\"Ya\"",
	    "\"exclamation\":true"
       "}";
	<b>char</b> *init(<b>void</b>)
	{
	    /* Set the settings for the "screamer" plugin */
	    json_t	*section, *settings;
	    section = json_by_name(json_config, "plugin");
	    settings = json_parse_string(screamer_settings);
	    json_append(section, json_key("screamer", settings));
	    <b>return</b> NULL;
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note the "start-list" member, whose value is an array of strings.
    These are the preferred settings for the "start" member, which is a
    single string.
    If you do something like <tt>-lscreamer,Wha</tt>, then the "Wha" will
    be recognized as a preferred value for "start", so that's where "Wha"
    will be stored.
    <p>
    The actual settings will be loaded later.
    At this point, you're just defining the names and default values (and hence
    data types), possibly along with some <var>xxx</var><tt>-list</tt> arrays
    of prefered values for some of the string options.
    Plugins and configuration settings do a fairly intricate dance,
    and this is near the start of it.
    The full sequence goes something like this:
    <ol>
      <li>The JsonCalc library's default options are loaded into the
          <tt>json_config</tt> variable.  The config file is loaded at
          this time too, just so we have a list of persistent plugins.
      <li>The command-line flags are scanned to determine whether this is
          going to be interactive or batch mode.  And also adjust the list
          of persistent plugins.
      <li>If interactive, then persistent plugins are loaded,
          adding their options to <tt>json_config</tt>.
      <li>The command-line flags are scanned again to locate and load
          any non-persistent plugins.  So all plugins are loaded at this
	  point, but we still only have hardcoded defaults for some options.
      <li>If interactive and there were any persistent changes to the
	  config settings, then the config file is saved
          so the persistent settings will indeed persist.
      <li>The command-line flags are scanned a third time.  Now we're
          processing any persistent changes to settings &mdash;
          either <b>-S</b><var>settings</var>,
          <b>-D</b><var>directory</var>,
          or <b>-L</b><var>plugin,settings</var>.
      <li>The command-line flags are scanned a fourth time, to add
          non-persistent settings to <tt>json_config</tt> &mdash;
          either <b>-s</b><var>settings</var>,
          <b>-d</b><var>directory</var>,
          or <b>-l</b><var>plugin,settings</var>.
      <li>Finally, scripts start to run or the user sees a "JsonCalc&gt;" prompt.
    </ol>
    <p>
    One implication of this is, <tt>init()</tt> can't check the config settings.
    The settings are only available later, when the user or script uses a
    feature of the plugin, e.g. by calling a function that the plugin provides.
      
    <h2>Hooks to Register Your Plugin's Services</h2>
    Every plugin adds some type of service to JsonCalc.
    The JsonCalc library defines functions to let you register the functions,
    commands, etc.

    <h3>Adding Functions</h3>
    Your plugin can add functions (written in C) to the JsonCalc expression
    syntax via the <tt>json_calc_function_hook()</tt>.
    For full details on how to do this, see the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=How_to_Add_a_Function">How to Add a Function</a> article.
    Briefly, though, the way to do it is:
    <ul>
      <li>Write your function in C.
          It should take two arguments: a <tt>json_t*</tt> containing an array
          of argument values, and a <tt>void*</tt> which can mostly be ignored.
          The function should return a <tt>json_t*</tt> as the result.
          To indicate an error, use <tt>json_error_null()</tt> to generate
          the return value.
          <pre>
            #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
            #include &lt;json.h&gt;
	    json_t *jfn_getpid(json_t *args, <b>void</b> *agdata)
	    {
		<b>return</b> json_from_int(getpid());
	    }
          </pre>
      <li>Register the function.  This should be done in your plugin's
	  <tt>init()</tt> function.
	  <pre>
	    <b>char</b> *init(<b>void</b>)
	    {
	        json_calc_function_hook("getpid", "", "number", jfn_getpid);
	        <b>return</b> NULL;
	    }
	  </pre>
      <li>Your function will be available for use in JsonCalc expressions
          whenever your plugin is loaded.
          <div class="example">
            <kbd>getpid()</kbd>
            <samp>12183</samp>
            This shows the process id to be 12183.
	  </div>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adding Commands</h3>
    Adding new commands is very similar to adding new functions:
    Write some functions in C, and then register those functions with
    JsonCalc via a <tt>json_cmd_hook()</tt> function.
    For details, see <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=How_to_Add_Commands">How to Add Commands</a>.
    Briefly, the process is:
    <ul>
      <li>Write a function to parse the command's parameters.
	  The JsonCalc library has a number of functions to help you
	  with that.
	  The function should return a <tt>jsoncmd_t*</tt> containing
	  the parsed command, or NULL if there's nothing that needs to be
	  run later.
	  (Function definitions are stored when parsed, for example,
	  so the "function" command parser returns NULL.)
	  If your parser detects an error, it should store the error in
	  a location passed as one of the parser function's arguments;
	  returning NULL does not indicate an error.
      <li>Write a function to run the parsed command.
	  This is passed the value returned by the parser, and the
	  context stack.
	  It should return NULL on success if there is no returned value,
	  or a jsoncmdout_t value to indicate success with a returned value,
	  an error, or a few other things like <b>break</b> or <b>continue</b>.
      <li>Register the parser and runner, along with the command's name,
	  via the <tt>json_cmd_hook()</tt> library function.
    </ul>
    <p>
    As a simple example, here's command that writes parenthesized text
    out to stderr.

    <pre>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <json.h>

	/* Parse a stderr command */
	jsoncmd_t *parse_stderr(jsonsrc_t *src, jsoncmdout_t **referr)
	{
	    char *text;
	    jsoncmd_t *cmd;

	    /* Parse the parenthesized text */
	    text = json_cmd_parse_paren(src);
	    if (!text) {
		*referr = json_cmd_src_error(src, 0, "The %s command expect text in parentheses", "stderr");
		return NULL;
	    }

	    /* Build a command */
	    cmd = json_cmd(src, "stderr");
	    cmd->key = text;
	    return cmd;
	}

	/* Run a stderr command */
	jsoncmdout_t *run_stderr(jsoncmd_t *cmd, jsoncontext_t *context)
	{
	    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", cmd->key);
	}

	/* ... and later, in the plugin's init() function... */
	char *init()
	{
	    json_cmd_hook("myplugin", "stderr", parse_stderr, run_stderr);
	    return NULL;
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Once the plugin is loaded, you can invoke the new command just like any
    other command.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>stderr Goodbye World!</kbd>
      <samp>1: The stderr command expects text in parentheses</samp>
      <kbd>stderr (Goodbye World!)</kbd>
      <samp>Goodbye World!</samp>
      The first command failed to parse because the text wasn't in parentheses.
      The second succeeded, and wrote the text to stderr.
    </div>

    <h3>Adding Global Variables and Constants</h3>
    Variables and constants are stored in the context.
    The <b>jsoncalc</b> program creates a context for the main process, and
    usually that's all you need.
    If you want to create another thread, you'll need another context for it,
    but that's unlikely.
    What is much more likely, though, is that you'll want to insert some
    layers into the context for your own variables and constants.
    There's a hook for that!
    Using the hook follows a familiar pattern.
    <ul>
      <li>First, write a function to add your layers to the context stack.
	  This function will take a single parameter, the top of the stack
	  that's under construction.
	  It will return a new top of the stack after you've added your
	  layers.
	  <p>
	  There's a <tt>json_context(context, data, flags)</tt> function
	  for adding layers.
	  The <tt>data</tt> parameter is a json_t object, and the members
	  will be either vars or consts depending on the flags.
	  The new context layer will also have a few other fields that you
	  might want to modify, including a
	  <var>context</var><tt>-&gt;autoload()</tt> function pointer
	  to create new variables on demand, and a
	  <var>context</var><tt>-&gt;modified()</tt> function pointer to
	  respond to changes in the layer's variables.
	  <p>
	  You can create multiple layers if you want, for example one layer
	  for vars and another for consts.
      <li>Second, the plugin's <tt>init()</tt> function should register the
	  context adder function via <tt>json_context_hook()</tt>.
      <li>Later, your vars and consts will be available for use in any
	  expression.
    </ul>
    <p>
    The <b>-d</b><var>directory</var> autoload directories are implemented
    this way.
    The <b>jsoncalc</b> program defines an autoload function and uses
    <tt>json_context_hook()</tt> to insert a layer that uses it.
    If an expression tries to use a variable that isn't defined (i.e.,
    not yet a member of the layer's "data" object), then the autoload
    function searches through the directory list for a file with the
    basename that matches the requested variable.
    If such a file is found, then it is parsed and its contents are added
    to the "data" object, so the variable reference can access the data.
    <p>
    Here's a simple example that adds a layer with consts named "verdad"
    and "falso" which return the boolean <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>
    values.
    <pre>
	jsoncontext_t *miContexto(jsoncontext_t *context)
	{
	    json_t *obj = json_object();
	    json_append(obj, json_key("verdad", json_bool(1)));
	    json_append(obj, json_key("falso", json_bool(0)));
	    <b>return</b> json_context(context, obj, 0);
	}

	<b>char</b> *init()
	{
	    json_context_hook(miContexto);
	    return NULL;
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Once your plugin is loaded, and the <b>jsoncalc</b> creates its context,
    your data will be available.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>verdad</kbd>
      <samp>true</samp>
      <kbd>falso ? "ja" : "nein"</kbd>
      <samp>"nein"</samp>
      No surprises.
    </div>

    <h2>Compiling and Linking</h2>
    Plugins are basically a type of shared library,
    and for GNU/Linux at least that means they need to be compiled as
    position-independent code.
    Using the GCC compiler, you need to add <tt>-fpic</tt> to the compiler
    command line, probably in the Makefile by setting <tt>CC=gcc -fpic</tt>.
    That's it!  No other special treatment is needed for compiling.
    <p>
    To package one or more compiled object files into a single shared
    library, use GCC with <tt>-fpic -shared</tt>.
    (The <tt>-shared</tt> tells GCC to make a shared library instead of an
    independent program.)
    You'll probably also want a <tt>-o plugin</tt><var>plugin</var><tt>.so</tt>
    flag to control the name of the generated file.
    <p>
    One neat thing is that if your plugin depends on other C libraries such as
    <tt>-linet</tt> for internet access, you can use those on the linker line
    and then they'll be loaded automatically whenever your plugin is loaded.
    The math plugin does this to add <tt>-lm</tt>, the C math library that
    it uses to do the actual computations, so its Makefile is a good example
    of this.

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    Your Makefile should copy the plugin's <tt>plugin*.so</tt> file to the
    <tt>plugin/</tt> directory.
    When you run "make install" at the top of the source tree,
    that'll copy any plugins from the <tt>plugin/</tt> directory their
    working location.

    <h2>Script Plugins</h2>
    It is also possible to write a plugin as a JsonCalc script,
    with no new C code at all.
    This tends to work well for simple plugins &mdash;
    things that JsonCalc could easily be configured to do without a plugin,
    but you want the easy distributability of plugins.
    For example, OAUTH2 authentication is pretty simple, so that'd be a
    good candidate.
    <p>
    Script plugins are copied to the <tt>plugin/</tt> directory just like
    binary plugins, but their names don't have a "lib" prefix, and the ".so"
    suffix is replaced with ".jc".

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    Your plugin's documentation should reside in a "www" directory under
    the plugin's source directory.
    This should mimic the structure of <b>jsoncalc</b>'s own "www" &mdash;
    functions in "www/f/", commands in "www/cmd", and the main intro in
    "www/index.html".
    <p>
    For example, the "math" plugin's source directory is "src/plugin/math/",
    so its documentation resides in "src/plugin/math/www/".
    <p>
    During installation, all of the documentation gets copied into a shared
    directory where users can access it even without internet access.
    <b>jsoncalc</b>'s built-in help facility will access it.
    Plugins' functions and commands are all tossed together in the web page
    so users can look up functions
