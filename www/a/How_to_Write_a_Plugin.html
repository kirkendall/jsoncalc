    This article explains how to write your own plugins.
    <p>
    The source code for plugins resides in the <tt>src/plugins</tt> directory.
    Each plugin gets its own subdirectory below that.
    So choose a name for your plugin, and create a directory with that name.
    I suggest you start by copying the math plugin's directory to your own
    plugin's directory.
    The math plugin is a good starting point because it is very simple.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>cp src/plugins/math/ src/plugins/myplugin</kbd>
    </div>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    Your plugin's *.c source file will need to include the <json.h> file
    so it can access JsonCalc's data types and functions.
    Some of the functions declared there use (FILE*), you'll also need
    to include <stdio.h>.
    You'll almost certainly need to include other headers too, but those
    two are the minimum.
    If your plugin uses multiple *.c files, then all of them will need
    at least those two.
    <p>
    The other mandatory feature of any plugin is that it must define an
    <tt>init()</tt> function.
    This is called when the plugin is first loaded, and it is responsible
    for doing any initialization such as registering new functions or
    commands with JsonCalc.
    It has no parameters.
    This function should return NULL on success, or an error message on failure.
    <p>
    The absolute minimum plugin, therefore, looks like this:
    <pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
	#include &lt;json.h&gt;

	<b>char</b> *init(<b>void</b>)
	{
	    <b>return</b> "Hello, world!  I am a plugin.";
	}
    </pre>
    <p>
    If your plugin uses options (either from the config file, or appended
    to the <tt>-lmyplugin</tt> command-line option),
    be aware that <em>options haven't been loaded yet</em> when the
    <tt>init()</tt> function is called.
    <p>
    Each plugin has its own independent namespace.
    Names that you give your functions or variables will never clash with
    names used in other plugins, so you shouldn't feel obligated to add a
    "myplugin_" prefix to every global function name; it just isn't necessary.
    For example, the <tt>init()</tt> function in your plugin will not
    cause a name clash with any other plugin's <tt>init()</tt> function.

    <h2>Hooks to Register Your Plugin's Services</h2>
    Every plugin adds some type of service to JsonCalc.
    The JsonCalc library defines functions to let you register the functions,
    commands, etc.

    <h3>Adding Functions</h3>
    Your plugin can add functions (written in C) to the JsonCalc expression
    syntax via the <tt>json_calc_function_hook()</tt>.
    For full details on how to do this, see the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=How_to_Add_a_Function">How to Add a Function</a> article.
    Briefly, though, the way to do it is:
    <ul>
      <li>Write your function in C.
          It should take two arguments: a <tt>json_t*</tt> containing an array
          of argument values, and a <tt>void*</tt> which can mostly be ignored.
          The function should return a <tt>json_t*</tt> as the result.
          To indicate an error, use <tt>json_error_null()</tt> to generate
          the return value.
          <pre>
            #include <unistd.h>
            #include <json.h>
	    json_t *jfn_getpid(json_t *args, void *agdata)
	    {
		return json_from_int(getpid());
	    }
          </pre>
      <li>Register the function.  This should be done in your plugin's
	  <tt>init()</tt> function.
	  <pre>
	    char *init(void)
	    {
	        json_calc_function_hook("getpid", "", "number", jfn_getpid);
	        return NULL;
	    }
	  </pre>
      <li>Your function will be available for use in JsonCalc expressions
          whenever your plugin is loaded.
          <div class="example">
            <kbd>getpid()</kbd>
            <samp>12183</samp>
            This shows the process id to be 12183.
	  </div>
    </ul>

    <h3>Adding Commands</h3>
      Adding new commands is very similar to adding new functions:
      Write some functions in C, and then register those functions with
      JsonCalc via a <tt>json_cmd_hook()</tt> function.
      For details, see <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?a=How_to_Add_Commands">How to Add Commands</a>.
      Briefly, the process is:
      <ul>
        <li>Write a function to parse the command's parameters.
            The JsonCalc library has a number of functions to help you
            with that.
            The function should return a <tt>jsoncmd_t*</tt> containing
            the parsed command, or NULL if there's nothing that needs to be
            run later.
            (Function definitions are stored when parsed, for example,
            so the "function" command parser returns NULL.)
            If your parser detects an error, it should store the error in
            a location passed as one of the parser function's arguments;
            returning NULL does not indicate an error.
	<li>Write a function to run the parsed command.
	    This is passed the value returned by the parser, and the
	    context stack.
	    It should return NULL on success if there is no returned value,
	    or a jsoncmdout_t value to indicate success with a returned value,
	    an error, or a few other things like <b>break</b> or <b>continue</b>.
        <li>Register the parser and runner, along with the command's name,
            via the <tt>json_cmd_hook()</tt> library function.
      </ul>
      <p>
      As a simple example, here's command that writes parenthesized text
      out to stderr.

      <pre>
          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <json.h>

	  /* Parse a stderr command */
	  jsoncmd_t *parse_stderr(jsonsrc_t *src, jsoncmdout_ **referr)
	  {
	      char *text;
	      jsoncmd_t *cmd;

	      /* Parse the parenthesized text */
	      text = json_cmd_parse_paren(src);
	      if (!text) {
		  *referr = json_cmd_src_error(src, 0, "The %s command expect text in parentheses", "stderr");
		  return NULL;
	      }

	      /* Build a command */
	      cmd = json_cmd(src, "stderr");
	      cmd->key = text;
	      return cmd;
	  }

	  /* Run a stderr command */
	  jsoncmdout_t *run_stderr(jsoncmd_t *cmd, jsoncontext_t *context)
	  {
	      fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", cmd->key);
	  }

	  /* ... and later, in the plugin's init() function... */
	  char *init()
	  {
	      json_cmd_hook("myplugin", "stderr", parse_stderr, run_stderr);
	      return NULL;
	  }
      </pre>
      <p>
      Once the plugin is loaded, you can invoke the new command just like any
      other command.
      <div class="example">
        <kbd>stderr Goodbye World!
        <samp>1: The stderr command expects text in parentheses</samp>
        <kbd>stderr (Goodbye World!)
        <samp>Goodbye World!</samp>
        The first command failed to parse because the text wasn't in parentheses.
        The second succeeded, and wrote the text to stdout.
      </div>

      <dt>void json_context_hook(jsoncontext_t *(*addcontext)(jsoncontext_t *context))
      <dd>This gives you a way to insert extra layers into the context stack.
          A DBMS interface might use this, for example, to create global
          variables for the tables in the current database.
          <p>
          <pre>
              jsoncontext_t *addMyContext(jsoncontext_t *context)
              {
		json_t *obj = json_object;


              }

              ...

              json_context_hook(
	  </pre>

      <dt>context->autoload()

    </dl>

    <h2>Compiling and Linking</h2>
    Plugins are basically a type of shared library,
    and for GNU/Linux at least that means they need to be compiled as
    position-independent code.
    Using the GCC compiler, you need to add <tt>-fpic</tt> to the compiler
    command line, probably in the Makefile by settings <tt>CC=gcc -fpic</tt>.
    That's it!  No other special treatment is needed for compiling.
    <p>
    To package one or more compiled object files into a single shared
    library, use GCC with <tt>-fpic -shared</tt>.
    (The <tt>-shared</tt> tells GCC to make a shared library instead of an
    independent program.)
    You'll probably also want a <tt>-o lib</tt><var>plugin</var><tt>.so</tt>
    flag to control the name of the generated file.
    <p>
    One neat thing is that if your plugin depends on other C libraries such as
    <tt>-linet</tt> for internet access, you can use those on the linker line
    and then they'll be loaded automatically whenever your plugin is loaded.
    The math plugin does this to add <tt>-lm</tt>, the C math library that
    it uses to do the actual computations, so its Makefile is a good example
    of this.

    <h2>Installing</h2>
    Your Makefile should copy the plugin's <tt>lib*.so</tt> file to the
    <tt>plugin/</tt> directory.
    When you run "make install" at the top of the source tree,
    that'll copy any plugins from the <tt>plugin/</tt> directory their
    working location.

    <h2>Script Plugins</h2>
    It is also possible to write a plugin as a JsonCalc script,
    with no new C code at all.
    This tends to work well for simple plugins &mdash;
    things that JsonCalc could easily be configured to do without a plugin,
    but you want the easy distributability of plugins.
    For example, OAUTH2 authentication is pretty simple, so that'd be a
    good candidate.
    <p>
    Script plugins are copied to the <tt>plugin/</tt> directory just like
    binary plugins, but their names don't have a "lib" prefix, and the ".so"
    suffix is replaced with ".jc".
