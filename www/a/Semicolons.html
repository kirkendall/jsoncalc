      A brief discussion of where semicolons are required after statements,
      where they're optional, and why.
    </blockquote>

    Most commands are terminated with either a semicolon (";") or a block
    of code in curly braces ("{...}").
    The only exceptions are the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=case">case</a> and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=default">default</a> commands,
    which end with a colon (":").
    <p>
    But semicolons are optional at the end of a script;
    Obviously the last command ends there.
    This is particularly convenient for interactive use,
    since each line of input is parsed as though it was a separate script file.
    The context (variables and such) carry forward from one command line entry
    to the next, but each interactively entered line is parsed as its own
    separate command sequence.
    This is why you don't need to place semicolons at the end of command lines.
    <p>
    This is also why you can't split long commands across multiple lines
    interactively.
    Script files can certainly contain multiple lines, but not interactively
    entered commands.
    It seems like a worthy compromise.
    <p>
    Semicolons are also optional before the "}" marking the end of a block
    of code.
    This one was easy to add, and it makes short functions a tiny bit easier
    to enter.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>function factorial(n) { return product(2...n) }</kbd>
      Define a simple factorial function.
      I could have put a ";" before the "}" but it isn't strictly necessary.
