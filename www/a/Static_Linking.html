      "jcstatic" is a statically-linked version of JsonCalc.
      Statically linked programs are easier to install on remote systems
      because there's just one file to install and it avoids a lot of
      dependencies on other libraries.
      However, the executable file is <em>much</em> larger and it uses more RAM.
      The ability to use plugins is severely limited (but not entirely gone).
      Some library dependencies are unavoidable.

    <h2>What Is Static Linking?</h2>
    "jcstatic" is a statically-linked version of the "jsoncalc" program.
    This refers to the way that libraries are incorporated into the program.
    <p>
    Libraries can be either statically linked or dynamically linked.
    Dynamic linking is generally preferred because it allows different programs
    to share the same copy of the library in RAM, allowing the RAM to be used
    more efficiently.
    (Dynamically-linked libraries are also called shared libraries.)
    The executable files are much smaller, since the libraries aren't included
    in them.
    <p>
    Static linking, on the other hand, copies the relevant parts of any
    libraries into the program file.
    The program thus has its own private copy of each library function that
    it uses.
    This makes the executable program <em>much</em> larger, but also makes it
    less dependent on the libraries that are installed on the system where you want to
    run it.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>ls -l bin</kbd>
      <samp><pre style="font-size: 125%">total 2332
-rwxr-xr-x 1 steve users 2305240 Jul 20 16:14 jcstatic
-rwxr-xr-x 1 steve users   81352 Jul 20 13:38 jsoncalc</pre>
      </samp>
      The "jcstatic" file is far larger than "jsoncalc" because it includes
      the jsoncalc library, selected plugins, and any system libraries that
      any of those depend on.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Do It</h2>
    Static linking can solve one very specific problem:
    When you copy a dynamically-linked program to another host,
    you sometimes find that the program won't run
    because it depends a library that isn't installed.
    If you hunt down that library and install it, then that'll often reveal
    yet another dependency.
    <p>
    In the case of JsonCalc, when you install "jsoncalc" you must also install
    "libjsoncalc.so" where "jsoncalc" can find it (usually <tt>/usr/lib64/</tt>
    on Linux systems).
    Any plugins that you want to use must also be copied over.
    And since the "curl" plugin depends on the libcurl.so library, you have
    to hope that a new enough version of that is installed.
    And it isn't just plugins &mdash; Does the remote host have a new enough
    version of the <tt>libreadline.so</tt> library? And <tt>libtinfo.so</tt>
    that it depends on?
    <p>
    So installing a dynamically-linked program can be a big time waster,
    and for a program like JsonCalc you might need it in a hurry.
    The statically-linked version of JsonCalc includes (nearly) all of the
    libraries that it depends on, in one big executable.
    Just copy "jcstatic" to the other host and it will run.

    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    JsonCalc's plugins are really just dynamically-linked libraries,
    and the statically-linked "jcstatic" program can't load them at run time.
    This <em>does not mean</em> you can't use plugins.
    You just need to have the foresight to include the plugins you need in
    the "jcstatic" executable.
    <p>
    JsonCalc produces a static "libsoncalcplugins.a" library
    containing all of the plugins.
    This library is only used linking into "jcstatic", and the linker will
    only include the plugins that you specifically want.
    <p>
    This is separate from the "libjsoncalc.a" library containing the core of
    JsonCalc, by the way.  Don't get them confused.
    The version of the <tt>json_plugin_load()</tt> function in the static
    "libjsoncalc.a" library contains a list of plugins to include in the binary.
    By adjusting the list, you can make any plugin available to "jcstatic".
    But there's a catch: Some of the plugins depend on other libraries, which
    may in turn depend on other libraries, all of which will get sucked into
    "jcstatic", making it truly huge.
    <p>
    Another consideration is that some of the libraries that a plugin depends
    on might not be available in statically-linked form.
    For example, my development system doesn't have a "libcurl.a" file anywhere
    so I can't compile a version of "jcstatic" that includes the "curl" plugin.

    <h2>How to build "jcstatic" with plugins that you choose</h2>
    You'll need JsonCalc's source code for this.
    <style>
      table.referencelist.steps td { vertical-align:top; }
      table.referencelist.steps td:nth-child(2) { font-family:monospace; font-size:125%; white-space:nowrap; }
    </style>
    <table class="referencelist steps">
      <tr><td>1</td><td>cd src/lib</td><td>Go into the library source directory</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>vi Makefile</td><td>Edit the Makefile.  I'm using vi here, but any text editor will do.</td</tr>
      <tr><td>3</td><td>/^STATIC=</td><td>Search for the "STATIC=..." line.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td>f=lC-DSTATICCSV -DSTATICLOG&lt;esc&gt;</td><td>
	Change the text after "=" to list the plugins you want.
	Each plugin name should be written in uppercase, with "-DSTATIC" before
	it.
	The example here would make the "csv" and "log" plugins available in
	the statically-linked program.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>ZZ</td><td>Save the changes</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>vi plugin.c<br/>/staticplugins ...</td><td>
        Most people can skip this step,
        but <strong>if you've written your own plugins</strong> then
        you need to add them to the "staticplugins" array in <tt>plugin.c</tt>.
        All of the standard plugins are already listed there, so this is only
        needed if you've added custom plugins.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>7</td><td>cd ../..<br/>make clean<br/>make</td><td>Do a clean "make" in the project top directory.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8</td><td>ls -l bin</td><td>
	Check to see if the "lcstatic" program was generated.
	If so, then <em>great!</em> you're done!
	If not, it's probably because one or more plugins that you requested
	depend on static libraries that aren't available.
        The next step helps with that.
      </td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>cd src/jsoncalc<br/>make</td><td>
        If "jcstatic" didn't compile, then go into the source directory of
        the "jsoncalc" and "jcstatic" programs and run "make".
        This is likely to generate a lot of output so you'll probably have to
        scroll back to see the good stuff.
        Look for one of two things:
        <ul>
          <li>Some other library that couldn't be found, required by a plugin.
            Even if a shared/dynamic version of the library is available,
            sometimes there is no static version,
            and we need the static version.  Maybe you can install it?
            You'd only need to install it on your own computer.
            Otherwise, go back and deselect the plugin that needs that
            library.
	  <li>Clashing symbol definitions.  If two different plugins define
	    a global symbol using the same name, that's a bug.  Plugins should
	    ideally reside in a single *.c file and the only non-static
	    declaration should be for the <tt>plugin</tt><var>name</var><tt>()</tt>
	    function.
	    Either fix it, or deselect the offending plugin.
	</ul>

    In the end <tt>bin/jcstatic</tt> is the statically-linked JsonCalc that
    you wanted.
