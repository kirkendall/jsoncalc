      The <tt>json_t</tt> data type is used to represent data parsed from
      a JSON document.  It uses a tree structure.  There are tree nodes
      representing the 6 basic data types.  Most usage is pretty simple,
      but there are a few quirks.  Strictly speaking, you don't need to know
      this unless you're writing C code that uses the JsonCalc library, but
      even if you only use JsonCalc interactively with a few basic scripts,
      this information might still be interesting.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    The JsonCalc library, and any C program that uses it, will make extensive
    use of <tt>json_t</tt> pointers.
    In this article, we'll discuss the contents of a <tt>json_t</tt>, and how
    a tree of them is used to represent data parsed from a JSON document.
    <p>
    The <tt>json_t</tt> structure is defined in &lt;json.h&gt; as follows:
    <pre>
      typedef struct json_s {
        struct json_s *next;	/* next element of an array or object */
        struct json_s *first;	/* contents of this object, array, or key */
        jsontype_t type : 4;	/* type of this json_t node */
        unsigned    memslot:12; /* used for JSON_DEBUG_MEMORY */
        char        text[14];	/* value of string, number, boolean; name of key */
      } json_t;
    </pre>
    <p>
    The most important field is <tt>type</tt>.
    It identifies the JSON data type that this <tt>json_t</tt> contains,
    and will be one of the following symbols:
    JSON_BOOL, JSON_NULL, JSON_STRING, JSON_NUMBER, JSON_ARRAY, JSON_OBJECT,
    or JSON_KEY.
    <p>
    The <tt>text</tt> field generally stores string values, and the
    <tt>first</tt> field points to embedded data.
    I'll explain the details of how they're used for each JSON data type later
    in this article.
    Spoiler: For long text, JsonCalc allocates a jumbo-sized <tt>json_t</tt>
    so the <tt>text</tt> field is big enough.
    <p>
    The <tt>next</tt> field is used for representing array elements or object
    members as a linked list.
    That makes <tt>next</tt> an unusual field because it's not about this
    <tt>json_t</tt>; it's about the outer <tt>json_t</tt> that contains it.
    Each element of an array, for example, will have a pointer to the next
    element of the array.
    The array uses each element's <tt>next</tt> to implement the linked list
    that stores the array.
    <p>
    The <tt>memslot</tt> field is used to track memory usage if you compile
    your program with -DJSON_DEBUG_MEMORY.
    You can ignore it; it takes care of itself.

    <h2>Null</h2>

    A JSON <tt>null</tt> is represented by a <tt>json_t</tt> with JSON_NULL
    stored in its <tt>type</tt> field.
    The other fields aren't used.

    <h3>Nulls with an error message</h3>

    JavaScript has many symbols for handing special cases such as <tt>NaN</tt>
    for "not a number" where a number would normally be expected.
    Those symbols aren't valid in JSON though, so JsonCalc uses <tt>null</tt>
    for all errors.
    Since <tt>null json_t</tt>'s <tt>first</tt> and <tt>text</tt> fields aren't
    used for a basic NULL, JsonCalc will sometimes store error codes and text
    into those fields. 

    <h2>Boolean</h2>

    A JSON boolean value is stored in a <tt>json_t</tt> with JSON_BOOL stored
    in its <tt>type</tt> field.
    The <tt>text</tt> field will contain either "true" or "false".
    You can use <tt>json-&gt;text[0] == 't'</tt> to test whether a
    boolean <tt>json_t</tt> is true or not
    (though the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?lib=json_is_true">json_is_true()</a> function is preferred).

    <h2>String</h2>

    A JSON string value is stored in a <tt>json_t</tt> with JSON_STRING stored
    in its <tt>type</tt> field.
    If the string is too long to fit in <tt>text</tt> then JsonCalc will
    allocate extra space to extend the size of <tt>text</tt>.
    <p>
    Strings are always stored in UTF-8 coding.
    Any backslash escapes such as \n or \u0533 are converted first to Unicode
    and then to UTF-8, so the string is what it is.
    No further processing of backslashes is needed.
    <p>
    The <tt>first</tt> field is unused.

    <h2>Number</h2>

    A JSON number is stored in a <tt>json_t</tt> that has JSON_NUMBER stored
    in its <tt>type</tt>field.
    <p>
    Values parsed from a JSON document are stored as strings in the
    <tt>text</tt> field.
    They are <em>not</em> immediately converted to binary for two reasons.
    <p>
    First, conversion between binary and text formats is about the slowest
    thing you can do with a floating point number because the CPU has no
    magic opcode to do it in hardware.
    Most numbers in a JSON document will either be entirely ignored, or
    they'll just be copied to the output verbatim.
    Either way, converting is a waste of time.
    <p>
    Second, conversion looses precision.
    The value 0.01 can't be exactly represented in floating point.
    We can minimize the consequences of  that by keeping numbers in text form... until we need to do math on them.

    <h3>Binary numbers</h3>

    Not all numbers used by JsonCalc are parsed from JSON documents though.
    Number literals in scripts, or the results of computation, will be stored
    in binary.
    Again, this is done for the sake of speed and precision.
    <p>
    To store a binary number in a <tt>json_t</tt>, the first byte of the
    <tt>text</tt> field is set to '\0' so the text is effectively an empty
    string.
    The second byte (<tt>json-&gt;text[1]</tt>) is set to 'i' for integer
    values, or 'd' for double-precision floating point values.
    Two macros, JSON_INT(json) and JSON_DOUBLE(json), let you access the
    last 4 or 8 bytes of the <tt>text</tt> field as an <tt>int</tt> or
    <tt>double</tt>.

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    Arrays are stored as linked lists.

    <h3>Optimizations</h3>
    Since arrays don't use the <tt>text</tt> field,
    we can use part of it to store a pointer to the end of the array.
    This is desirable because it speeds up appending to an array
    <em>a hell of a lot!</em>
    If we had to scan the whole array to add the next element every time,
    then building an array would have complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), but
    with a tail pointer it's just O(n).
    And JSON data often contains large arrays, so this really means something.
    <p>
    There is a JSON_END_POINTER(json) macro which lets you access the last
    8 bytes of the <tt>text</tt> field as a pointer to the last element.

    <h3>Deferred Arrays</h3>
    The JsonCalc library supports deferred arrays.
    Instead of loading the whole array into RAM,
    the parser just does a quick scan to find its end (so it can parse whatever
    comes after the array), count its length, and check whether it is a table
    (array of objects).
    For deferred arrays, the <tt>array->first->type</tt> will be JSON_DEFERRED
    instead of a normal data type.
    <p>
    When C code wants to scan an array, it normally does so by calling the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?lib=json_first">json_first(<var>array</var>)</a>
    and <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?lib=json_next">json_next(<var>elem</var>)</a>
    functions.
    If the array is entirely in RAM, then these are basically the same as
    <var>array</var><tt>-&gt;first</tt> and <var>elem</var><tt>-&gt;next</tt>.
    <p>
    But for deferred arrays, those functions find and retrieve the information
    wherever it may be.
    That usually means re-parsing the big array, one element at a time,
    and then freeing that element before moving to the next one.
    This is actually slower than parsing the big table once,
    but it saves RAM so it can be worth doing because of that.
    <p>
    Deferred arrays aren't used only for large arrays from JSON documents.
    They can be produced by other sources.  For example, the expression
    <tt>1...1000000</tt> does not immediately allocate a million <tt>json_t</tt>
    structures to store the array; it returns a deferred array that can step
    through the whole range, one integer at a time.

    <h2>Objects and Keys</h2>
    Objects are basically arrays of members.
    Like arrays, their contents are stored in a linked list.
    <p>
    A <tt>json_t</tt> containing JSON_OBJECT in its <tt>type</tt> field
    represents the object as a whole, and its <tt>first</tt> field points
    to its first member.
    <p>
    Each member is a <tt>json_t</tt> that has JSON_KEY in its <tt>type</tt>
    field.
    The member's key (name) is stored in the <tt>text</tt> field, and the
    value is pointed to by the <tt>first</tt> field.
    The <tt>next</tt> field is used to implement the linked list.

    <h3>Classes</h3>
    JsonCalc doesn't support class... yet.
    The expectation is that it will some day, and each object's class name
    will be stored in its <tt>text</tt>field.
    <p>
    It's important to note that objects from a JSON document are always
    generic objects.  No Class.

    <h3>Optimizations</h3>
    While parsing objects from a JSON document, we use the same
    JSON_END_POINTER(json) macro trick that we use with arrays.
    <p>
    We only do this while parsing JSON documents, not while updating
    objects via scripts;
    this is because updates need to scan the object to avoid adding duplicates.
    That isn't an issue when parsing a JSON document though.
    <p>
    Since objects parsed from a JSON never have a class, they never use
    the <tt>text</tt> field to store a class name, leaving it free to store
    the JSON_END_POINTER(json).
    Objects elsewhere don't use JSON_END_POINTER(json) so <tt>text</tt> is
    available to store a class name.
    Hence, there is never a conflict there.
