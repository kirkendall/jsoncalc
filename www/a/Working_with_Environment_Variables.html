      Environment variables are managed by shells such as bash.
      JsonCalc is often used in shell scripts, so environment variables
      can be a useful way to get raw data into a JsonCalc script.
      Jsoncalc lets you access environment variables using $NAME,
      $NAME[expr], and getenv(expr).

    JsonCalc can be an effective way to build JSON documents from raw data,
    but first you need a way to get the raw data into your script.
    One way to do that is by setting environment variables.
    <p>
    Environment variables are managed by shell program such as <em>bash</em>.
    The syntax varies from one shell to another, but typically you can
    set a persistent environment variable via an "export" command, or
    pass any number of temporary environment variables into a program by
    listing the "<var>name</var>=<var>value</var>" before the program name.
    If you're using JsonCalc in a shell script, this is often the easiest
    way to pass values into JsonCalc.
    <p>
    Environment variable names are case-sensitive, unlike most of JsonCalc.
    Usually they're written entirely in uppercase, though they don't have
    to be.
    <p>
    JsonCalc has three ways to access environment variables:  
    $NAME notation used like a JsonCalc const,
    $NAME[expr] notation to synthesize the full name by appending the
    result of the subscript expression, and the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=getenv">getenv()</a> function.

    <h2>$NAME</h2>
    You can use $NAME in any expression, as though $NAME was the name of a
    const.
    This makes environment variables super easy to access.
    If there is no environment variable with the requested <var>NAME</var>,
    then the "$<var>NAME</var>" expression returns <b>null</b>.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>$PATH</kbd>
      <samp>"/home/steve/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"</samp>
      <kbd>$PATH.split(":")</kbd>
      <samp>["/home/steve/bin","/usr/local/bin","/usr/bin","/bin"]</samp>
      The first example fetches the $PATH environment variable's value.
      The second example uses it in an expression.
    </div>

    <h2>$NAME[expr]</h2>
    Often you'll want to pass many similar items into a script.
    Environment variable store strings, not arrays, so the next best thing
    is to append a number to the name of the environment.
    For example, you could pass a bunch of part numbers into a JsonCalc
    script via a series of environment variables named $partno1, $partno2,
    and so on.
    JsonCalc's $<var>NAME</var>[<var>expr</var>] notation makes this easy
    to access.
    <p>
    The subscript expression is evaluated first.
    If the result isn't a string, then it will be converted to a string,
    and appended to the <var>NAME</var>.
    In the part number example, this means JsonCalc could access them as
    <tt>$partno[i]</tt>.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>$partno[1]</kbd>
      <samp>"10017"</samp>
      Fetches the value of $partno1.
      Note that the value is always a string, even though this particular value
      looks like it could truly be a number.
      You can convert strings to numbers via the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=parseInt">parseInt()</a>
      and
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=parseFloat">parseFloat()</a>
      functions
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>1..10 @ $partno[this]</kbd>
      <samp>["10017","12565-B"]</samp>
      This collects <tt>$partno1</tt> through <tt>$partno10</tt> into an array.
      Any missing $partno<var>N</var> variables will be omitted from the array,
      because those $partno<var>N</var> expressions return <b>null</b> and the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a> operator omits
      <b>null</b> from its result array.
    </div>

    <h2>The getenv() function</h2>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=getenv">getenv()</a>
    function is passed a name, and returns the value.
    Both the name and the returned value are strings.
    If there is no environment value with the requested name,
    then <b>null</b> is returned.
    <p>
    The only advantage of <tt>getenv()</tt> over the $NAME notation is that
    <tt>getenv()</tt> gives you a way to compute the name.
    With $NAME, the name is always hardcoded in the script.
    <div class="example">
      <kbd>var name="PATH"; getenv(name)</kbd>
      <samp>"/home/steve/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"</samp>
      This fetches the value of the $PATH environment variable.
    </div>

    <h2>Putting It All Together in a Shell Script</h2>
    Here's a shell script that sets some environment variables, and runs
    JsonCalc to add their values to a document.
    <pre>
    #!/bin/sh

    export partno1=10017
    export desc1="Shaving Cream"
    export qty1=2
    export partno2=12565-B
    export desc2="Tooth Paste"
    export qty2=1

    custno=133 pono=2029 jsoncalc -c "
    {
       custno: $custno,
       po: $pono,
       detail: (1..10 @ $partno[this] ? {partno:$partno[this], desc:$desc[this], qty:parseInt($qty[this]))
     }"
    </pre>
    When run, this should produce output similar to the following:
    <pre>
    {
      "custno":"133",
      "po":"2029",
      "detail":[
        {
          "partno":"10017",
          "desc":"Shaving Cream",
          "qty":2
	},
	{
	  "partno":"12565-B",
	  "desc":"Tooth Paste",
	  "qty":1
	}
      ]
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
    First we set some environment variables storing the part information.
    Then we set a couple more (<tt>custno</tt> and <tt>pono</tt>) as we
    invoke JsonCalc.
    We use JsonCalc's "-c cmd" flag to pass the whole JsonCalc script as
    an argument.
    The script stuffs the environment variables into an object.
    The parts are collected in a "detail" member, as an array of objects.
    The the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a> expression
    that builds the array, we loop over 10 possible part slots, and use
    "$partno[i] ? " to skip over ones that aren't used.
    For the used slots, we get corresponding
    <tt>partno</tt>, <tt>desc</tt>, and <tt>qty</tt> values.
    The <tt>qty</tt> is converted from a string to an integer.
    Since the expression isn't assigned to a variable,
    JsonCalc simply outputs it.
