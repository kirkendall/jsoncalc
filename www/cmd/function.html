      The <tt>function</tt> command lets you define functions.
      <p>
      Usually you'll invoke <tt>function</tt> with the name of the function
      to define, a parenthesized list of parameters, and a <var>cmd</var> to run
      &mdash; typically a series of commands enclosed in curly braces,
      but it could also be a single command terminated with a semicolon.
      This adds a new function, or replaces an existing one.
      <p>
      You can also skip the <var>cmd</var>.  This creates the function but
      doesn't specify a body for it.
      Invoking the function will do nothing.
      This version of the <tt>function</tt> command exists mostly because the
      parser won't let you try to call a function that hasn't been defined,
      so if you're writing a recursive function you need to define it twice
      &mdash; once with an empty body just so it exists, and then with the
      recursive body which is allowed to recursively call itself.
      <p>
      Lastly, you can invoke <tt>function</tt> with just the name of a function
      to get a summary description of the function.
      This works even for the built-in functions.
      <p>
      The <var>arglist</var> can be empty (just parentheses with nothing in them).
      Generally, though, it is a comma-delimited list of argument names.
      Each name may be followed by a "?" to mark it as optional,
      a ":" followed by a data type, and/or an "=" and an expression
      that provides a default value.
      <p>
      So, yes you can declare argument types and the function's return type,
      in the manner of <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
      But the declarations don't actually do anything yet.
      Think of them as comments &mdash; useful, but they won't save you.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>function backward(arr:array): array { var out=[]; for (arr) out = concat([this], out); return out; }</kbd>
	<kbd>backward(1..5)</kbd>
	<samp>[5,4,3,2,1]</samp>
        This defines a function that reverses the elements of an array.
        It's pretty basic &mdash; it just uses a
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=for">for</a>-loop and the
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=concat">concat()</a> function
        to insert each element of the argument array to the front of the result
        array.
        <p>
        Please forgive the ugly formatting.  It is presented this way
        so the entire <tt>function</tt> command is on a single line, which is
        necessary when you're entering commands into JsonCalc interactively.
        In script files, you can split it across multiple lines to improve
        readability, like this:
        <pre>
        function backward(arr : array) : array {
	    var out = [];
	    for (arr)
	        out = concat([this], out);
	    return out;
        }
        </pre>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>function backward</kbd>
	<samp>function backward(arr)</samp>
	<kbd>function touppercase</kbd>
	<samp>builtin function toUpperCase(str)</samp>
	Invoking <tt>function</tt> with a name but no argument list causes
	JsonCalc to output what it knows about the named function.
	This works for both user-defined and built-in functions.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>function factorial(n);<br/>
	function factorial(n) { if (n&lt;2) return 1; return n * factorial(n-1);}<br/>
	factorial(5)</kbd>
	<samp>120</samp>
        Here's an example of a recursive function.
        First we declare the <tt>factorial()</tt> function without a body.
        The function has to exist before we can use it,
        even for a self-reference in a recursive function.
        Once the function exists (albeit in a do-nothing state)
        we can use it in the actual recursive definition.
        <p>
        Again, please forgive the ugly formatting.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>The <tt>function</tt> command is unusual in that it is executed
            immediately when it is parsed, and after that it is omitted from
            the series of parsed commands.
            (In practice, this doesn't matter much.)

	<li>You can't use <tt>function</tt> to redefine any of the built-in
	    functions.

	<li>JavaScript doesn't support "= <var>defaultvalue</var>" in the
	    <var>arglist</var>.  JsonCalc doesn't support JavaScripts "fill"
	    operator in arglist.

	<li>Although the TypeScript-style type declarations don't do anything
	    currently, they almost certainly will at some point.
	    Don't get sloppy with your type declarations.
