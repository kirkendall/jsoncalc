    <dl>
      <dt>import <var>filename</var>
      <dd>
      Load jx code from another file.
      This can be used to split large scripts into multiple files, so you
      load one script and it uses <tt>import</tt> to load the rest.
      This can also be handy when running interactively if you decide that
      a written-but-not-loaded script might be handy for analyzing or
      converting the data.
      <p>
      The <tt>import</tt> command doesn't stop you from loading the same
      file twice.
      This is intentional.
      You might find a bug in a script, edit it in another window to correct
      the bug, and then use <tt>import</tt> to reload the corrected version.
      <p>
      If the filename you give doesn't include a filename extension, then
      ".jc" will be assumed.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>import stats.jc</kbd>
        This reads any variables or functions from stats.jc, so they're
        available for your script or interactive session.
      </div>

      <ul>

        <li>I used the name "import" to make this command easier for JavaScript
            programmers to find, but are significant differences.
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript can't load from files, only from HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
                  jx can only load from files.
	      <li>JavaScript has extra keywords to control which parts of the
	          external script get loaded.  jx just loads everything.
	      <li>JavaScript requires quotes around the external script's name.
	          jx doesn't, partly for convenience and partly to make
	          <tt>import</tt> more closely resemble the
	          <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=file">file</a>
	          command for loading data files.
	    </ul>

	<li>For security reasons, the script file's name can't start with "/"
	    or contain "../".

	<li>There is also a <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=plugin">plugin</a> command
	    which loads plugins.
	    Plugins can be implemented as either
	    a binary file containing native code, or
	    a jx script, or a mixture of the two.
	    Since both <tt>import</tt> and
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=plugin">plugin</a>
	    can load jx scripts, there is a bit of overlap.
	    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=plugin">plugin</a>
	    command is more powerful, but it looks for plugins to load in
	    separate directories.
	    Use <tt>import</tt> for your scripts, and
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=plugin">plugin</a> for 
	    code contributed by other programmers.
      </ul>
