      <dt>print <var>value</var>, ...
      <dd>
      Given a comma-delimited list of expressions, this outputs each expression
      without any modification.
      In particular, strings are written as raw UTF-8 text,
      no padding is inserted between items, and no newline is added at the end.
      Data types other than strings are output pretty much the same as they
      would be without the <tt>print</tt> command.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>print "\e[34mWow!\e[m\n"</kbd>
	<samp style="color:#0000ff">Wow!</samp>
        "\e" is an ASCII escape character, so "\e[34m" is an escape sequence
        for blue text.
        After "Wow!", another escape sequence turns off the color, and 
        "\n" adds a newline since <tt>print</tt> won't add one by itself.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>print "The current file uses ", sizeof(data), " bytes of RAM\n"</kbd>
        <samp>The current file uses 3616 bytes of RAM</samp>
        An example showing a comma-delimited list of values in a single
        <tt>print</tt> command.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>This command exists mostly as a convenient way to output strings
            without quotes or backslash escapes.
            You could achieve a similar effect via "-Ostring"
            but <tt>print</tt> is more convenient.

	<li>Although <tt>print</tt> doesn't automatically add a newline,
	    the interactive "JsonCalc:" prompt does.

      </ul>
