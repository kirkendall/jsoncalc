      This allows you modify the settings interactively.
      <p>
      The settings are always available via a global <tt>config</tt> const.
      You aren't allowed to modify <tt>config</tt> directly because rules
      must be enforced &mdash; You can't create new options or set a boolean
      to "maybe", for example.
      The <tt>set</tt> command lets you modify config in a controlled manner.
      <p>
      The arguments are basically comma-delimit list of changes.
      You don't need to quote the new values of string option, unless you
      want to include whitespace or other funky characters.
      For booleans, you can set them to <tt>true</tt> just by giving their name
      without any "=value", and you can set them to <tt>false</tt> by giving
      their name with a "no" prefix.
      <p>
      Also, some options are strings that have a list of allowed (or at least
      preferred) values.
      For those options, you can set them just by giving the value without
      a "name=".
      The "table" option is an example of this.
      You can set "table" to "csv" just by running "<tt>set csv</tt>".
      <p>
      Some options are complex objects.
      The text attributes such as <tt>gridhead</tt> are examples of this.
      For these options, you can give a space-delimited list of settings.
      For example, "<tt>set gridhead=underlined cyan</tt>" will set the
      <tt>config.gridhead.underlined</tt> boolean option to <tt>true</tt>,
      and the <tt>config.gridhead.fg</tt> string option to "cyan" because
      "cyan" appears in the list of values for "fg".
      <p>
      You can also give an expression in parentheses to compute the option
      settings at run-time.
      The expression must return a string formatted as described above.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>set null="-"</kbd>
        A simple example to start.  This sets the "null" option, so that
        null values in tables will be displayed as "-".
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>set ascii</kbd>
        <kbd>set noascii</kbd>
        Here's an example that turns boolean option on, and then off again.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>set gridhead=underlined bold cyan, gridline=bold cyan</kbd>
	<kbd>config.gridhead.fg</kbd>
	<samp>"cyan"</samp>
        Here we're invoking set with two option changes.
        The first is a space-delimited list of changes for
        <tt>config.gridhead</tt> (which is an object) to set the
        <tt>underlined</tt> and <tt>bold</tt> boolean members to <tt>true</tt>,
        and the <tt>fg</tt> string member to "cyan".
        JsonCalc knows that "cyan" is a setting for <tt>fg</tt> because
        it appears in the list of preferred values for <tt>fg</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>const myFavoriteColor="green"</kbd>
        <kbd>set ("set gridhead="+myFavoriteColor)</kbd>
        Here's an example using a computed option string.
        It will change the color of column headings to green.
        It will also retain the "bold" and "underlined" attributes because
        I didn't explicitly turn them off.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>The "-O<var>options</var>" command line flag uses the same syntax
            as the <tt>set</tt> command's arguments.

        <li>Name completion (the &lt;Tab&gt; key) works differently for the
            <tt>set</tt> command.
            You don't need to fully type out "underlined" in the above example.

	<li>To examine options, use the global constant <tt>config</tt>.

	<li>Some output formatting options are stored separately for batch
	    mode versus interactive mode.
	    This was done so the batch scripts will behave the same for all
	    users, even if you change your interactive preferences.
	    The <tt>set</tt> command will change the interactive preferences.
	    For batch scripts, use the -O flag.
	    There's also a global constant <tt>runmode</tt> which indicates
	    which JsonCalc is currently using.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>runmode</kbd>
	      <samp>"interactive"</samp>
	      <kbd>config[runmode].table</kbd>
	      <samp>"grid"</samp>
	      This shows that JsonCalc, in its current run mode, will use
	      the "grid" style when printing tables.
	    </div>
