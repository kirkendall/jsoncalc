      <dd>
      The <tt>throw</tt> command triggers an error.
      The error may be caught by a <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=try">try/catch</a> command,
      or it may be reported to the user.
      It is passed one, two, or three comma-delimited arguments.
      <p>
      The first argument is an optional error code number.
      If given, this must be a literal number &mdash; not a symbolic constant
      or other expression.
      If omitted, then 0 is assumed.
      <p>
      The first mandatory argument is the text of an error message.
      It must be a literal string.
      It may contain a single "%s" token to indicate where the final argument
      is to be inserted.
      Other printf-style placeholders are not allowed.
      <p>
      If the message contains a "%s" then the third argument is mandatory;
      without "%s" it it forbidden.
      Unlike the other arguments, this one is <em>not</em> limited to just
      being a literal.
      It can be any expression at all, but if the result isn't a string
      then it might be displayed as "".
      <p>
      The error message (first string) may be translated via the locale.
      The extra argument (if the error message uses %s) is not translated.
      Consequently, I suggest using the %s to give a module name, function name,
      or other symbol that shouldn't be translated.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>throw "Pow!"</kbd>
	<samp style="color:red">Line 1: Pow!</samp>
        This generates an error with the message "Pow!".
        Since we didn't try to catch the error, it was displayed to the user.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>throw "Bad arguments in %s module", "log"</kbd>
	<samp style="color:red">Line 1: Bad arguments in log module</samp>
	This time we used %s in the message, and added another argument
	containing the module name.
	This way, if "Bad arguments in %s module" gets translated
	to "Argumentos incorrectos en el m&oacute;dulo %s" or whatever,
	"log" will still remain "log".
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>try {throw "Pow!"} catch (e) { e }</kbd>
	<samp>{"line":1,"code":0,"message":"Pow!"}</samp>
        This time we caught the error and displayed the object representing
        the error.
        There is no filename because this command was entered at the command
        prompt, not read from a script.
        The line number is 1 because each line entered at the command prompt
        is processed as its own separate thing; every entered line is line 1.
        We did not use an error code argument, so the code is 0.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>This is different from JavaScript's <tt>throw</tt>.
            In JavaScript you would typically do something like
            <tt>throw new Error("Zap!")</tt> but since JsonCalc doesn't
            really have object classes, I had to simplify it.

      </ul>
