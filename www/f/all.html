      This returns <tt>true</tt> if the <var>bool</var> argument is <tt>true</tt>
      for all rows in a group, when used with the # or ##  operator.
      If passed an array of booleans, it will return <tt>true</tt> if all elements are
      <tt>true</tt>.
      <p>
      This is an aggregate function, meaning it accumulates the count over a
      series of table elements when used with the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">#</a> operator, or a
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=select">SELECT</a> clause.
      You may also pass it an array to have it accumulate results across the
      elements of that array.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>all([false,false,true,false])</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
        Some of the values in the argument array are not <tt>true</tt>,
        so the result is <tt>false</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run")  #  all(score &gt;= 20) ? run</kbd>
	<samp>[2,3]</samp>
	This checks the <tt>test.scores</tt> table in the sample data, looking for
	runs where all scores are 20 or more.
	Runs 2 and 3 satisfy that condition, so <tt>[2,3]</tt> is returned.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>11...100 # all([2,3,5,7] # that % this)</kbd>
	<samp>[11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97]</samp>
        Fun fact: Any number that is not a prime must have a prime factor
        that is less than or equal to its square root.
        This means that if you have a list of the primes less than or equal
        to 10, you can use that to find the primes less than or equal to 100.
        In the example shown here,
        <tt>that</tt> is a number from <tt>11...100</tt>, and
        <tt>this</tt> is a number from the list of small primes.
        If <tt>that</tt> leaves a remainder when divided by all small primes,
        then it gets added to the result list.
