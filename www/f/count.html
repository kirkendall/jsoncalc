    <h1>count - Count items</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>count( <var>arg</var><span class="type">:any</span> ) <span class="type">:number</span>
      <br/>count(*) <span class="type">:number</span>
      <dd>
      Return a count of instances where <var>arg</var> is not
      <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.
      You may also use an asterisk in place of <var>arg</var>
      to count all instances unconditionally.
      <p>
      This is an aggregate function, meaning it accumulates the count over a
      series of table elements when used with the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=select">SELECT</a>,
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each"># or ##</a> operators.
      You may also pass it an array to have it accumulate results across the
      elements of that array.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>count([false, false, true, true, false])</kbd>
	<samp>2</samp>
        Here we're applying it to an array.
        Only 2 of the items are not <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[false, false, true, true, false] # count(this)</kbd>
	<samp>[2,2,2,2,2]</samp>
        Here we're using it with the <tt>#</tt> operator.
	The count is repeated 5 times because <tt>#</tt> is an array filter,
	which is converting each <tt>true/false</tt> to the count.
	You could wrap the whole expression in parentheses and add <tt>[0]</tt>
	to get just the first copy of the count.
	<kbd>([false, false, true, true, false] # count(this))[0]</kbd>
	<samp>2</samp>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>emojis.groupBy("group") # {group, count(*)}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>group</th><th>count(*)</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>face</td><td>4</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>misc</td><td>2</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
        Divide the "emojis" table into groups via the "group" member, and return
        the group and count for each.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>For the sake of being more SQL-like, <tt>count(*)</tt>
            (with an asterisk where the argument should be)
            counts all instances.
            This is effectively the same as <tt>count(true)</tt>.

	<li>SQL's <tt>COUNT()</tt> aggregate function is slightly different though.
	    It only excludes <tt>NULL</tt>;
	    <tt>FALSE</tt> values will be included in the tally.
	    I chose to make jx be incompatible in this way so you could
	    use conditional expressions in the <tt>count()</tt> argument.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>[this.scores] # count(score &lt; 30)</kbd>
	      <samp>[4]</samp>
	      This scans <tt>test.scores</tt> (part of the sample data) for
	      rows with a score less than 30.
	      We wrapped <tt>[test.scores]</tt> in brackets so the
	      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">#</a> operator
	      would treat it as one group instead of 9 separate rows.
	      <p>
	      By the way, you might be tempted to use an expression like
	      <tt>count(score &lt; avg(score))</tt> to count rows with a
	      below average score, but that won't work because
	      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=avg">avg()</a>
	      doesn't return a value until the end of the group or array,
	      but the argument to <tt>count()</tt> would need it for each row.  
	      To make this work, you'd need to generate the average first,
	      in a separate expression.
	      <kbd>var avg = (test.scores # avg(score))[0];</kbd>
	      <kbd>[this.scores] # count(score &lt; avg)</kbd>
	      <samp>[4]</samp>
	    </div>

        <li>If all you want to do is check the size of an array,
            <kbd>array.length</kbd> will be much faster than
            <kbd>array.count(*)</kbd>.
            Function calls aren't very efficient.
            Arguments are passed by value, so <tt>array.count()</tt>
            acts on a copy of the array, while <tt>array.length</tt>
            can act on the original array &mdash; no copying needed.
