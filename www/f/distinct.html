    <h1>distinct - Remove duplicates from an array</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>distinct( <var>arr</var><span class="type">:array</span>, <var>strict</var><span class="type">?:boolean</span>, <var>columns</var><span class="type">?:string[]</span> ) <span class="type">:array</span>
      <dd>
      Return a copy of array <var>arr</var> with duplicates removed.
      <p>
      Normally it only compares adjacent elements when looking for duplicates.
      If the optional <var>strict</var> argument is <tt>true</tt> then it looks
      for duplicates anywhere in the array.
      <p>
      Two elements are normally considered to be duplicates if the === operator says
      they're equal.
      When dealing with objects, === compares all members, and it compares strings
      case-sensitively. 
      You can change that behavior by passing <var>columns</var> &mdash;
      a member name as a string, or a list of member names as an array of strings.
      If the values of the corresponding members are strings, then those strings will
      be compared case-insensitively.
      Members not listed in <var>columns</var> will not be tested.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[1,2,3,3,1,2,4].distinct()</kbd>
	<samp>[1,2,3,1,2,4]</samp>
        The second 3 was deleted as a duplicate because it came immediately after
        the first 3.
        The second 1 and second 2 were not detected.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[1,2,3,3,1,2,4].distinct(true)</kbd>
	<samp>[1,2,3,4]</samp>
        All duplicates were detected, since the <var>strict</var> argument is <tt>true</tt>.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>In an SQL-like "SELECT" statement, the "DISTINCT" keyword is transformed
        into a call of this function.

        <li>This is not an aggregate function.
