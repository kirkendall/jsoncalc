      This is very handy when you're digging through data, trying to find
      that special nugget.
      <p>
      <tt>find()</tt> does a deep search
      through an object or array (the "<var>haystack</var>")
      for a given value (the "<var>needle</var>").
      If you don't specify a <var>haystack</var> to search through,
      it'll use the default table &mdash; the same one that the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=select">SELECT</a> operator
      uses without a <tt>FROM</tt> clause.
      <p>
      The <var>needle</var> may be a number, string,
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?lit=regex">regular expression</a>
      or <tt>null</tt>
      If it is a string, the search will be case-sensitive unless you also
      pass a <tt>true</tt> argument to make it case-insensitive.
      If it is a regular expression, then <tt>find()</tt> will look for text
      matching that regular expression within any string in the data.
      When <var>needle</var> is a string or regular expression, then it will
      only match strings; if it is a number then it will only match numbers.
      When <var>needle</var> is <tt>null</tt>, it will match any value;
      this is most useful when used with a <var>key</var> argument.
      <p>
      If you pass an optional <var>key</var> argument, then the search will
      be limited to finding object members with the given key.
      The <var>key</var> is given as a string, so use quotes.
      For example, if you wanted to find part#199 in an array of invoices,
      where each invoice contains an array of parts, then you could pass
      <tt>"partno"</tt> as the <var>key</var> to prevent <tt>199</tt> from
      matching other members such as price.
      <p>
      The result of the search is a table of matches.
      The columns of the table are:
      <table class="referencelist">
        <tr><th>index</th><td>
          This is the the array subscript where it was found.
          If there are nested arrays, this will be the index into the outermost
          array.
          If there are no arrays then this member will be omitted.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><th>key</th><td>
          If an object member's value is a match, then this will be the
          key (name) of that member.
          If the match is an array element, but the array is the value of an
          object's member, then that member's key (i.e., the array's name)
          is used here.
          As usual in JsonCalc, the member name comparison is case-insensitive.
          If there are no objects then this will be omitted.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><th>value</th><td>
          This is a copy of the matching value.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><th>expr</th><td>
          This is a string that looks like a JsonCalc (or JavaScript)
          expression for reaching the match.
          If you explicitly pass a <var>haystack</var> argument, then
          this will be relative to the <var>haystack</var>.
          If you let the default table be the <var>haystack</var>,
          then the expression will include the default table's name
          (usually "this", "data", or something in "data").
        </td></tr>

      </table>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.find("Portland")</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	  <tr><th>index</th><th>key</th><th>value</th><th>expr</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>0</td><td>city</td><td>Portland</td><td>cust[0].contact[0].city</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>city</td><td>Portland</td><td>cust[3].contact[0].city</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	<tt>test</tt> is part of the sample data.
	We're searching for the string "Portland", and find it in two places,
	both of them in the <tt>cust</tt> table within <tt>test</tt>.
	The <tt>index</tt> column shows the subscripts into <tt>cust</tt>
	of the matching strings.
	The <tt>key</tt> column shows that both were found to be city names.
	The <tt>value</tt> column is "Portland", which is no surprise.
	The <tt>expr</tt> column reveals that both matches occurred within
	the <tt>contact</tt> tables within their respective <tt>cust</tt>
	objects.
	Since we explicitly passed <tt>test</tt> has the <var>haystack</var>,
	these expressions are relative to <tt>test</tt>; we know that
	<tt>test.cust[0].contact[0].city == "Portland"</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.find(3)</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	  <tr><th>index</th><th>key</th><th>value</th><th>expr</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>6</td><td>run</td><td>3</td><td>scores[6].run</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>7</td><td>run</td><td>3</td><td>scores[7].run</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>8</td><td>run</td><td>3</td><td>scores[8].run</td></tr>
	  <tr><td></td><td>deepest</td><td>3</td><td>deep.deeper.deepest</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	A simple example of searching for a number.
	The last match didn't involve any arrays,
	so its <tt>index</tt> member was omitted.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>find("Janet")</kbd>
        <samp>
	  <table>
	  <tr><th>index</th><th>key</th><th>value</th><th>expr</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>1</td><td>first_name</td><td>Janet</td><td>data[1].first_name</td></tr>
	  </table>
        </samp>
        Here's an example using the default table.
        To get this result, I invoked the <b>jsoncalc</b> program with the
        name of a *.json file; the contents of that file were thus available
        as "<tt>data</tt>".  The file contains a JSON array of objects,
        so the whole <tt>data</tt> is the default table.
        Note that the <tt>expr</tt> column starts with "data" to indicate this.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

	<li>Passing a <tt>true</tt> parameter won't make regular expressions
	    be case-insensitive.
	    Instead, do that by appending the letter "i" after the
	    regular expression's closing "/" character.

        <li>Regular expressions normally look for matching text anywhere
            within a string value; it doesn't need to exactly match the whole
            string.
            If you want to require the regular expression to match the whole
            string like a string <var>needle</var> would,
            use the <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt> metacharacters.
            <div class="example">
              <kbd>test.find(/^portland$/i)</kbd>
              <samp>
		<table>
		<tr><th>index</th><th>key</th><th>value</th><th>expr</th></tr>
		<tr><td>0</td><td>city</td><td>Portland</td><td>cust[0].contact[0].city</td></tr>
		<tr><td>3</td><td>city</td><td>Portland</td><td>cust[3].contact[0].city</td></tr>
		</table>
	      </samp>
	      This searches for "portland" with no extra characters before or
	      after it.  Because the regular expression is followed by an "i"
	      flag, the search is case-insensitive.
            </div>

        <li>In the result table, the <tt>index</tt> and <tt>key</tt> members
            are not as symmetrical as they might appear.
            <tt>index</tt> is always the outermost array subscript.
            <tt>key</tt> is always the innermost member name.

	<li>The <tt>expr</tt> result column is meant to be human-readable.
	    You can copy-and-paste it into command lines easily.
	    However, there is no convenient way to automatically evaluate
	    the expression, or pick it apart.

	<li>Here's something related but different:
	    Subscripting allows you to select an element in an array of objects
	    by specifying the member's key and value.
	    For example, if you have an array of purchase orders that each
	    have a "ponumber" member, then you could search for PO#1234 via
	    "<tt>po[ponumber:1234]</tt>".
