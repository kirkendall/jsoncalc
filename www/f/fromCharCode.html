      Convert character codepoint numbers to a string.
      <p>
      This accepts a variable number of arguments.
      All are converted and integrated into the returned string.
      They may be:
      <ul>
        <li>Numbers.  Each number is a Unicode codepoint, converted to a single character.
        <li>Strings.  Strings are just concatenated into the result string.
        <li>Arrays.  Each element may be a number or string, processed as above.
      </ul>
      <p>
      (JavaScript supports a variable number of numeric arguments, but not strings
      or arrays.)

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>fromCharCode(89, 101, 115)</kbd>
	<samp>"Yes"</samp>
	Those are the ASCII/Unicode codepoints for the letters "Y", "e", and "s".
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>fromCharCode([89, 101, 115])</kbd>
	<samp>"Yes"</samp>
	Same thing, but passed as a single array.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>fromCharCode([89, 101, 115], "terday")</kbd>
	<samp>"Yesterday"</samp>
        Mixing arrays, numbers, and strings.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"SPARKLE!".charCodeAt(1...4).fromCharCode()</kbd>
	<samp>"PARK"</samp>
	Here, <tt>charCodeAt()</tt> generates an array of character codepoints
	from the middle of a string, and <tt>fromCharCode()</tt> reassembles them
	to recreate the substring.
      </div>
