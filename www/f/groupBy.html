    <h1>groupBy - Split a table into groups</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>groupBy(<var>table</var>, <var>columns</var>)
      <bt/>groupBy(<var>table</var>, <var>columns</var>, <var>totals</var>)
      <dd>
      This splits a table (array of objects) into an array of arrays of objects.
      <p>
      This is mostly to affect the scope of aggregate functions when used with
      the @ and @@ operators.
      For example, if you have a table of sales data which contains a "region" column
      (meaning each row/element/object has a "region" member)
      then you might want to group them by region so you could report the regional
      totals or averages.
      (Yes, this corresponds to the SQL "GROUP BY" clause.)
      <p>
      The <var>table</var> is simply an array of objects.
      Each element is a row, and then members of the rows' objects serve as columns.
      <p>
      The <var>columns</var> list is an array of strings, corresponding to the object
      member keys (column names).
      For the sake of convenience, if you just want to sort by a single column in
      ascending sequence, you can just pass its name as a string, instead of an
      array of strings.
      <p>
      This doesn't sort the items;
      it is assumed that all items to be grouped are already in consecutive rows.
      If that assumption isn't true, then you should sort then via
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=orderBy">orderBy()</a> before calling <tt>groupBy()</tt>.
      You can use the same <var>columns</var> parameter for both.
      (<tt>groupBy()</tt> only compares for equality so it doesn't need <tt>true</tt>
      to denote descending sorts, but it is smart enough to skip over <tt>true</tt>
      if it appears in the <var>columns</var> argument.)
      <p>
      If you pass a <var>totals</var> parameter, then <tt>orderBy()</tt> will append an
      extra object to the end of the response array, containing a single member with
      first name from the <var>columns</var> parameter as the member's key (name), and
      the <var>totals</var> value as its value.
      Due to the way @ and @@ interact with aggregates, this causes any columns that
      use aggregate functions to apply those functions across all rows instead of
      splitting by the group.
      This makes it easy to get combined totals.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>groupBy(test.scores, "run")@{run,avg(score)}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th>avg(score)</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>31.6666666667</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	The "test.scores" table is already sorted by "run" so we don't need to
	explicitly sort it.
	The @ operator outputs one record per group, in this case containing the
	run number and the average score within that run.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores.orderBy("name").groupBy("name","OVERALL")@{name,avg(score)}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>name</th><th>avg(score)</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>35</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>25</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>21.6666666667</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>OVERALL</td><td>27.2222222222</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	This time we're fetching the averages by name, so we need to sort and group
	by name.
	Also, we added "OVERALL" as a <var>totals</var> label,
	so we got a row for the overall average too.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run")@@score&lt;avg(score)?{run,name,score}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th> name</th><th>score</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>Peter</td><td>10</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>Peter</td><td>25</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>Peter</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>Paul</td><td>25</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	The difference between @ and @@ is that @ outputs one row per group, while
	@@ outputs one row per row.
	We're using @@ here to list the run, name, and score of anybody who got less
	than the average score for their run.
	Note that we got two rows from run 3.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>The result of <tt>groupBy()</tt> is no longer a table.
        Instead, it is an array of tables,
        possibly with an oddball "totals" object added in.
        The @ and @@ operators work with this, and will reassemble the results as a
        table again.
