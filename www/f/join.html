    <h1>join - Collect strings into a single long string</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>join( <var>str</var><span class="type">:string</span>, <var>delim</var><span class="type">?:string</span> ) <span class="type">:string</span>
      <dd>
      The <tt>join()</tt> function concatenates strings together
      to form a single long string.
      <p>
      The <var>delim</var> argument is optional.
      If you omit it, "," is used as the default.
      <p>
      This is an aggregate function, meaning it accumulates the result over a
      series of table elements when used with the
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">#</a> operator, or a
      <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=select">SELECT</a> clause.
      You may also pass it an array of strings to have it accumulate results
      across the elements of a that array.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>join(["life", "the universe", "and everything"])</kbd>
	<samp>"life,the universe,and everything"</samp>
        Here we're applying <tt>join()</tt> to an array of strings.
        This example uses the default delimiter,
        which is just a comma with no spaces.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.cust # join(name)</kbd>
        <samp>[
  "Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy",
  "Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy",
  "Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy",
  "Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy"
]</samp>
	<kbd>[test.cust] # join(name)</kbd>
        <samp>["Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy"]</samp>
	<kbd>(test.cust # join(name)).distinct()</kbd>
        <samp>["Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy"]</samp>
        The first example here joins the <tt>name</tt> members of each element
        of the <tt>test.cust</tt> table (which is part of the sample data),
        however it returns a copy of the combined names for each row.
        The second and third examples return a single element containing the
        joined string, by making them be a nested array representing a single
        group, and by using the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=distinct">distinct()</a> function, respectively.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>SELECT join(name) AS combined FROM test.cust</kbd>
        <samp>
<table>
<tr><th>combined</th></tr>
<tr><td>Peter,Paul,Mary,Ziggy</td></tr>
</table>
        </samp>
        Here's an SQL-like example.
        The result is a table (array of objects instead of simple strings),
        so by default it is displayed as a table.
        The use of aggregates in the
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=select">SELECT</a> clause
        implies that it should use DISTINCT.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript has an <var>array</var>.<tt>join(</tt><var>delim</var><tt>)</tt>
            function which joins an array of strings to form a single large string.
            JsonCalc's <tt>join()</tt> function will behave identically when
            passed an array of strings.
            JavaScript does not have aggregate functions.
