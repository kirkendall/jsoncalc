If I wanted to store the function documentation as JSON, what would that
look like?

Maybe a big object, where the function name is the member key (name) and
the value stores info about the function.  The value would be an object
with the following members:

summary
	A one-line description

sections
	An array of strings from the list ["string","number","array","object",
	"datetime","aggregate"].  Maybe "boolean" if I ever have a boolean
	function.

parameters
	An array of arrays of strings.  Each subarray lists a calling variation.
	For example, the item for join() would have [["arr"],["arr","delim"]]

description
	An array of text (strings), bullet lists (arrays) and examples
	(objects with "code", "output", and maybe "text" members).

	When converting to HTML, we'd need to look within the text for
	things that might be links or highlighted words, so we can add the
	appropriate HTML cruft.  This would be done for all for strings
	in the "description" array including bullet list arrays, and for
	"text" members of examples.  The things to highlight would be:

	  * Library data types, starting with "json" and ending with
	    "_t".  This would be converted to a link to the datatype
	    reference.

	  * Library functions, starting with "json_" and followed by
	    "()".  This would be converted to a link to the library
	    function reference.

	  * Calc functions, followed by "()" but *NOT* starting with
	    "json_".  This would be converted to a link to the calc
	    function reference.

	  * The function that the page is about, ending with "()" and
	    having the same name as this function entry.  It would be
	    wrapped in <tt> tags.  I.e., reference pages shouldn't link
	    to themselves.

	  * Parameter names should be wrapped in <var> tags.

	  * A few other words whould be highlighted, mostly "-ljson"
	    and "jx".

examples (optional)
	An array of example objects, similar to what the description can use.

notes (optional)
	An array of strings providing bullet points about the function's
	quirks or useful tricks, or objects containing examples.
	These strings and objects are subject to the same automatic
	highlighting/linking as other text.  Objects should be considered
	to be part of the note that precedes them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The above sounds fairly clean to me.

Here's the complete entry for join():

{
  "name":"join",
  "summary":"Combine an array of strings into a single string",
  "sections":["array"],
  "parameters":[["arr"],["arr","delim"]],
  "description":[
    "The join() function concatenates an array of strings together to form a single long string.",
    "The delim argument is optional.  If you omit it, \",\" is used as the default."
  ],
  "examples":[
    {
      "code":"join([\"life\", \"the universe\", \"and everything\"])",
      "output":"\"life,the universe,and everything\"",
      "text":"This example uses the default delimiter, which is just a comma with no spaces."
    }
  ]
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The advantages of putting the documentation in a JSON file are:
 * It could become the basis of the help system.
 * It's easier to refactor the website layout.
 * It's more compact than HTML pages, so easier to edit.

The disadvantages are:
 * Mangling the text to add links and highlights could be non-trivial.
 * I hate XML because its a text markup language masquerading as a data
   language.  So now I'm contemplating using a real data language as a
   text markup language?

It'd be interesting to see if I could come up with a jx script that
converts its own documentation to HTML.  There's *a lot* of work I'd need
to do before I could even consider that.
