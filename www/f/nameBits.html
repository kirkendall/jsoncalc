    <h1>nameBits - Decode a bitmap</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>nameBits(<var>int</var>, <var>names</var>, <var>delim</var>)
      <br/>nameBits(<var>int</var>, <var>names</var>)
      <dd>
      Returns the names of "1" bits in <var>int</var>.
      <p>
      The <var>delim</var> parameter is optional.
      If you supply a <var>delim</var> string, then the function returns a string
      with <var>delim</var> inserted between the names of the set bits.
      Without a <var>delim</var>, the function returns an object in which the member
      names reflect the set bits, and the values of those members are the bits
      themselves.
      <p>
      The <var>names</var> is an array of strings giving the bit names.
      <var>names</var>[0] is the name of the 2^0 bit,
      <var>names</var>[1] is the name of the 2^1 but, and so on.
      <p>
      You can also get fancy.
      If an element of <var>names</var> is itself an array, then that subarray
      is used as an enumeration of a group of bits.
      The length of the subarray is rounded up to the next power of 2, and that
      determines how many bits the subarray will use to select a name.
      The first name in a subarray corresponds to the first <strong>non-zero</strong>
      value in that field.
      If you want to assign a name to the all-zeroes bit pattern, then the subarray's
      length must be exactly a power of 2 and the last element will then be used for
      the all-zeroes bit pattern.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>nameBits(6, ["one","two","four"], "+")</kbd>
	<samp>"two+four"</samp>
	The value 6 has the second and third bits set, so the names "two" and "four"
	are used.
	We also pass "+" as the delimiter, so that's inserted between the names.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>nameBits(6, ["one","two","four"])</kbd>
	<samp>{"two":2,"four":4}</samp>
	  <td>
	    This is the same as the first example, except we don't pass a delimiter
	    so the returned value is an object.
	  </td>
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>nameBits(13, ["bold","italic",["sub","super","base"]])</kbd>
	<samp>{"bold":1,"base":12}</samp>
	This example uses a subarray of names.
	Since there are 3 names in the subarray,
	it will use 2 bits from <var>int</var>.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want the names as an array, the simplest way to do get it is
        to apply the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=keys">keys()</a> function to the object.
        <div class="example">
	  <kbd>nameBits(13, ["bold","italic",["sub","super","base"]]).keys()</kbd>
	  <samp>["bold","base"]</samp>
        </div>

        <li>If you add up the values of the returned object's members, you should get
        the original <var>int</var> back.
        (This assumes you've defined a name for every bit.)

        <li>For single bits, the value of the corresponding object member will always
        have a non-zero value.
        This means you can use the member name as though it was a boolean.
        <div class="example">
	  <div class="calc">nameBits(13, ["bold","italic",["sub","super","base"]]).bold ? "heavy" : "light"</div>
	  <div class="result">"heavy"</div>
        </div>
      </ul>
