      This accumulates key/value pairs into a new object, which it then returns.
      <p>
      This is an aggregate function, meaning it accumulates data over a series
      of table elements when used with the @ operator, or a <tt>SELECT</tt> clause.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>objectAgg(["a","b","c"],null)</kbd>
	<samp>{"a":null,"b":null,"c":null}</samp>
	<kbd>{a:1,e:2,i:3,o:4,u:5} &amp; objectAgg(["a","o"],null)</kbd>
	<samp>{"a":1,"o":4}</samp>
        This is about the simplest possible use of <tt>objectAgg()</tt>.
        While most aggregate functions take a single arguments and can do good things
        when passed an array, <tt>objectAgg()</tt> uses two arguments and only the
        first one can be an array to iterate over.
        <p>
        Surprisingly, this can be useful though.
        If you have an array of member names that you want to keep in an object,
        you could achieve that by using <tt>objectAgg()</tt> to convert the array
        to an object, and then use the
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=bitwise">&amp;</a>
        set intersection operator to select the members.
        The second example above is an example of this.
        Similarly, <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=bitwise">^</a> could
        be used to selectively delete members.
        <p>
        But it's a lot more common to use use <tt>objectgAgg()</tt> with the
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a> operator.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run")@objectAgg(name,score)</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>Peter</th><th>Paul</th><th>Mary</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>35</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr>
          </table>
        </samp>
        The test.scores table is an array of objects containing a "run" member
        (which it happens to be sorted by), and "name" and "score" members.
        The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=groupby">groupBy()</a> function splits the table into
        groups (segments) that share the same run number.
        The @ operator invokes the objectAgg() function for each object in each
        group, and then at the end of the group it retrieves the accumulated value.
        objectAgg() uses the name and score from each object to add a member to
        a new object which is accumulated across the group; I.e., it ends up
        containing one member for each name, with the score as that member's value.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>In the second example, if you wanted to add an extra column to show
        the run number, you could do it by using the | operator to combine the
        object returned by <tt>objectAgg</tt> with an object containing only the
        run number.
        <div class="example">
	  <kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run")@{run}|objectAgg(name,score)</kbd>
	  <samp>
	    <table>
	      <tr><th>run</th><th>Peter</th><th>Paul</th><th>Mary</th></tr>
	      <tr><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>30</td><td>35</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>3</td><td>30</td><td>25</td><td>40</td></tr>
            </table>
          </samp>
	</div>
        This is even surprisingly efficient.
        The @ operator only invokes the objectAgg() function for each row from
        the <tt>test.scores</tt> table, but not the whole right-hand-side operand
        of the @ operator.  The entire right-hand-side expression is only evaluated
        at the end of each group.  This means that <tt>{run}|</tt> is only evaluated
        once per run, not once per score.

        <li>In many cases,
            the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=values">VALUES</a>
            operator is easier to use for this sort of thing.
      </ul>
