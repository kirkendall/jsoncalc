    <h1>period - Transform a period</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>period(<var>str</var>, <var>args</var>)
      <br/>period(<var>obj</var>, <var>args</var>)
      <br/>period(<var>args</var>)
      <dd>
      This returns a period.
      <p>
      Normally periods are represented as strings in ISO-8601
      "P<var>n</var>Y<var>n</var>M<var>n</var>W<var>n</var>DT<var>n</var>H<var>n</var>M<var>n</var>S" format.
      Periods can also be represented by an object containing
      "year", "month", "day", "hour", "minute", and "second" members.
      The first argument can be a period in any of those formats,
      or a number to be combined with a field name as described below.
      <p>
      Any additional arguments can transform the period in useful ways.
      You can pass any mix of the following, in pretty much any order:
      <p>
      <table class="referencelist">
        <tr><th>Argument Value</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
        <tr><td><tt>true</tt></td><td>Return the period as an object.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"year" or "y",<br/>"month" or "mo",<br/>"day" or "d",<br/>"hour"or "h",<br/>"minute" or "mi",<br/>"second" or "s"</td><td>Return just the given field of the period as a number, or if used with a <var>number</var> argument then change that field in the period.  You may also pluralize the field names by appending "s".</td></tr>
        <tr><td><var>number</var></td><td>With one of the field names, change a field in the period to <var>number</var>. If no field name is given, "second" is assumed.</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      When changing time zones, the hour (and possibly other fields) will change
      so that the returned value represents the same point in time.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>period(3, "days")</kbd>
	<samp>"P3D"</samp>
	<kbd>period(90, "minutes")</kbd>
	<samp>"PT90M"</samp>
	<kbd>period(1, "hour", 30, "minutes")</kbd>
	<samp>"PT1H30M"</samp>
	Here we're generating periods from a number and a field name.
	Note that the last two represent the same amount of time, but
	show it in different ways.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>period("P3D", true)</kbd>
	<samp>{<br/>
	&nbsp; "year":0,<br/>
	&nbsp; "month":0,<br/>
	&nbsp; "day":3,<br/>
	&nbsp; "hour":0,<br/>
	&nbsp; "minute":0,<br/>
	&nbsp; "second":0<br/>
	}</samp>
	Convert the period to an object.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"P3D".period("hours")</kbd>
	<samp>72</samp>
	<kbd>"P3D".period(2, "hours")</kbd>
	<samp>"P3DT2H"</samp>
	The first example returns the 3-day period's duration in hours.
	Note that the larger time units get folded into the requested one.
	The second example sets the "hour" field of that duration to 2.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

	<li>Periods are not "normalized" after a field is changed.
	    You can set any field to a large positive or negative number
	    without having other fields adjusted to fit around it.
	    This is different from dates, which are normalized.
	    Periods can't be normalized because date/time/period
	    computation is messy, but keeping the fields separate makes
	    things a bit cleaner.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"2024-12-28" + period(45,"days")</kbd>
	      <samp>"2025-02-11"</samp>
	      <kbd>"2024-12-28" + period(1,"month")</kbd>
	      <samp>"2025-01-28"</samp>
	      The first example adds 45 days, and the second example adds 1 month.
	      The second period doesn't need to "know" that December has 31
	      days because it isn't doing day calculations,
	      it's doing month calculations.
	      If we tried to normalize the first period to something like
	      "1 month and 15 days" then we'd run into problems.
	    </div>

	<li>Despite the "no normalizing of periods" rule, when you extract one
	    field from a period, it does fold larger units into the requested
	    one.  This is a form of normalization.  It seems like a reasonable
	    compromise.  The only failing is that it assumes all months are
	    30 days, and all days are 24 hours.  Periods expressed in terms
	    of shorter units work fine.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"PT1H30M".period("minutes") == "PT90M".period("minutes")</kbd>
	      <samp>true</samp>
	      Here we can see that 1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 90 minutes.
	    </div>

	<li>ISO-8601 periods can also specify weeks.
	    For example, "P2W" represents a period of 2 weeks.
	    JsonCalc converts this to 14 days.

	<li>When passing field names, you can also use "time_t" as a synonym
	    for "seconds".  Since Unix's <tt>time_t</tt> data type measures
	    time in seconds, this works pretty well.

	<li>If you give "m" as the field name, then JsonCalc will try to
	    guess whether you meant "month" or "minute".
