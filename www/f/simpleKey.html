    <dl>

      <dd>
      The <tt>simpleKey()</tt> function transforms a string to allow for
      easy comparison.
      The "case insensitive" member name lookup uses the same rules as this
      function, so experimenting with this function can give you a better
      feel for how loose lookup works.
      <p>
      The transformations performed include:
      <ul>
        <li>Everything before the first ":" is deleted.
        <li>Control characters are deleted.
        <li>Zero-width characters (diacritics, mostly) are deleted.
        <li>Precomposed diacritics are converted to their base letter.
        <li>Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase.
        <li>&#xdf; and &#xc6;/&#xe6; are converted to SS and AE respectively.
        <li>"-" and "_" are removed, except at the beginning or end of the string.
      <ul>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Deleting everything before ":" is intended to let you access XML
            symbols without worrying about namespaces.
	<li>Deleting "-" helps with data from languages that allow hyphens
	    as part of a name, such as XML and CSS.
	<li>Deleting "_" lets us avoid the snakes-vs-camels debate.
	<li>Converting to uppercase avoid a lot of frustration, for example
	    whether an identifier member's key ends with "Id" or "ID".
	<li>Removing diacritics just saves time when typing.
	<li>The simplified string never requires more bytes than the original string.
	    In Unicode, the &#xdf;, &#xc6;, &#xe6; are represented by 2-byte
	    sequences, so converting them to two 1-byte letters doesn't use any
	    extra memory.
	    (This doesn't really matter in JsonCalc scripts, but I thought it was interesting.)
