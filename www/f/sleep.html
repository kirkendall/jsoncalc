    <h1>sleep - Pause execution for a given duration</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>sleep( <var>seconds</var><span class="type">:number|period</span> ) <span class="type">:null</span>
      <dd>
      This pauses execution for a given number of seconds, and then resumes.
      It always returns <tt>null</tt>.
      <p>
      Usually you'll pass the sleep duration as a number, representing seconds.
      It can be floating point number, allowing sleeping by fractions of a
      second.
      Alternatively, you can pass an ISO 8601 period string such as "PT1M30S"
      to sleep for one minute and 30 seconds.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>current_time;sleep(5);current_time</kbd>
	<samp>"12:22:36"<br/>
	null<br/>
	"12:22:41"</samp>
        This first shows the current time, then sleeps for 5 seconds (showing
        the <tt>null</tt> returned by <tt>sleep(5)</tt>), and finally shows
        the current time again.
        You can see that 5 seconds elapsed between the two time checks.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>current_time;sleep(0.5);current_time</kbd>
	<samp>"12:23:18"<br/>
	null<br/>
	"12:23:18"</samp>
        This is like the first example, but we only slept for half a second
        so the current time didn't change significantly.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>current_time;void sleep("PT1M");current_time</kbd>
	<samp>"12:24:37"<br/>
	"12:25:37"</samp>
	Here we're specifying the sleep time via an ISO 8601 period string.
	Also, we used the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=void">void</a> command to hide the <tt>null</tt> returned by <tt>sleep()</tt>.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>At the time of this writing, JsonCalc's support for fractions of
            seconds in ISO time periods is limited.
            I really should do something about that.
            For now, though, if you need to sleep a fraction of a second
            then you must specify the sleep time as a number.
