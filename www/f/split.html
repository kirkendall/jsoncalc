    <h1>split - Split a string into an array of substrings</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>split(<var>str</var>)
      <br/>split(<var>str</var>, <var>delim</var>)
      <br/>split(<var>str</var>, <var>delim</var>, <var>limit</var>)
      <br/>split(<var>str</var>, <var>regex</var>)
      <br/>split(<var>str</var>, <var>regex</var>, <var>limit</var>)
      <dd>
      The <tt>split()</tt> function divides <var>str</var> (a string)
      into an array of substrings,
      using either <var>delim</var> (a string)
      or <var>regex</var> (a regular expression) as the delimiter.
      <p>
      If no delimiter is specified, then <var>str</var> is simply wrapped
      in an array.
      Honestly, this isn't useful but it is standard.
      <p>
      When using a string delimiter,
      instances of <var>delim</var> are searched for within the string.
      The comparison is case-sensitive.
      If <var>delim</var> appears at the start or end of <var>str</var>,
      then the result array will include an empty string in those places.
      As a special case, when <var>delim</var> is "" (an empty string) then
      <var>str</var> is divided into characters.
      <p>
      When using a regular expression delimiter, it's pretty much the same.
      Searches will be case-sensitive unless you append an <tt>i</tt> flag
      to the end of the regular expression.
      Also, if <var>regex</var> uses any subexpressions
      (segments enclosed in \( and \) tokens) then the text matching the
      subexpressions will be included in the result array too.
      <p>
      The optional <var>limit</var> parameter is a number which sets an
      upper limit on the length of the result array.  If <var>limit</var>
      is positive, then the result array is simply clipped.
      If <var>limit</var> is negative, then its absolute value is used as
      the maximum length, and the last entry in the array will include all
      remaining text, even if that text contains more instances of the
      delimiter.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"one,two,three".split(",")</kbd>
	<samp>["one","two","three"]</samp>
        Commas are used to split the string into substrings.
        The original string contains two commas, so the result array contains
        three substrings.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"one, two,three".split(/, */)</kbd>
	<samp>["one","two","three"]</samp>
        This is similar to the first example, except that we're using a
        regular expression as the delimiter.
        This particular regular expression allows any number of
        space characters to appear after the comma.
        Within a regular expression, <tt>*</tt> means whatever appears
        immediately before it (a space in this example) may occur zero or more
        times.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"url=https://www.google.com?q=jsoncalc".split("=", 2)</kbd>
	<samp>["url","https://www.google.com?q"]</samp>
	<kbd>"url=https://www.google.com?q=jsoncalc".split("=", -2)</kbd>
	<samp>["url","https://www.google.com?q=jsoncalc"]</samp>
        Here we're splitting a
        <span class="nowrap">"<var>name</var>=<var>value</var>"</span>
        string into name and value.
        First we try using a <var>limit</var> of positive 2,
        but since the value also contains an "=", it gets clipped.
        Using a <var>limit</var> of -2 fixes that,
        because negative limits include all remaining text in the last element.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>"simple".split()</kbd>
        <samp>["simple"]</samp>
        <kbd>"simple".split("")</kbd>
        <samp>["s","i","m","p","l","e"]</samp>
        With no delimiter, <tt>split()</tt> doesn't split.
        The entire argument string is simply returned as the only element
        of an array.
        To split a string into individual characters, you have to give ""
        as the delimiter.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>JavaScript's version of <tt>split()</tt> doesn't support negative
            <var>limit</var> values.  That's a <strong>JsonCalc</strong>
            extension.

	<li>Try to avoid using regular expressions that could
	    match an empty string.
	    You'll generally be unhappy with the results.
	    If <var>regex</var> does match an empty string,
	    then <tt>split()</tt> will skip an extra character because
	    if it didn't then it'd get stuck in an infinite loop of empty
	    substrings.

	<li>If you want to eliminate empty strings from an array, the simplest
	    way to do it is via the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a> operator.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"*alpha*beta*".split("*") @ this != ""</kbd>
	      <samp>["alpha","beta"]</samp>
	      <tt>split()</tt> returns ["","alpha","beta",""], but the @ takes
	      each element of that array and applies the <tt>this!=""</tt>
	      expression to it; if that expression is false then the element
	      is discarded.  We end up with just the non-empty substrings.
	    </div>
