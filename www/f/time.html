      <dt>time(<var>str</var>, <var>args</var>)

      <br/>time(<var>num</var>, <var>args</var>)
      <dd>
      This returns a time.
      <p>
      Normally times are represented as strings in ISO-8601
      "<var>hh:mm:ss+hh:mm</var>" format.
      If the time zone is missing, then the local time zone is assumed.
      If Daylight Saving Time/Summer Time applies in your area then the
      current date is used to decide whether to switch.
      Times can also be represented by an object containing
      "hour", "minute", "second", "tz", "localtz", and "z" members,
      or by a Unix <tt>time_t</tt> number.
      The first argument can be a time in any of those formats,
      or a dateTime (from which only the time portion is used).
      <p>
      Any additional arguments can transform the time in useful ways.
      You can pass any mix of the following, in pretty much any order:
      <p>
      <table class="referencelist">
        <tr><th>Argument Value</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
        <tr><td><tt>true</tt></td><td>Return the time as an object.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"time_t" or "t"</td><td>Return the time as a <tt>time_t</tt> number</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"locale" or "l"</td><td>Return the time in the locale's preferred format</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"hour"or "h",<br/>"minute" or "mi",<br/>"second" or "s"</td><td>Return just the given field of the time as a number, or if used with a <var>number</var> argument then change that field in the time.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><var>number</var></td><td>With one of the field names, change a field in the time to <var>number</var></td></tr>
        <tr><td>"" or "Z" or "+<var>hh:mm</var>"</td><td>Change the time zone of the returned time.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>"%r", etc</td><td>Format the time like C's strftime() function. This gives you ways to derive the AM/PM status and other things</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      When changing time zones, the hour (and possibly other fields) will change
      so that the returned value represents the same point in time.
      This could cause the date to change, but since <tt>time()</tt> doesn't
      return dates, this can get confusing.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>time(now)</kbd>
	<samp>"17:35:12"</samp>
        The <tt>now</tt> variable is the current time as a Unix
        <tt>time_t</tt> number.  The time is returned in the default format.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>time(now, true)</kbd>
	<samp>{<br/>
	&nbsp; "hour":18,<br/>
	&nbsp; "minute":35,<br/>
	&nbsp; "second":43,<br/>
	&nbsp; "tz":-480,<br/>
	&nbsp; "localtz":true<br/>
	&nbsp; "z":false<br/>
	}</samp>
	This is the same, except that we passed an additional <tt>true</tt> 
	argument so the value is returned as an object.
	The value of "tz" is the number of minutes east of UTC.
	"z" would be true in the UTC time zone if the string format should
	use "Z" as the time zone instead of "+00:00".
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>time(now, "locale")</kbd>
	<samp>"06:36:24 PM"</samp>
        This returns the time in the locale's preferred format.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>time(now, "hour")</kbd>
	<samp>18</samp>
	<kbd>time("18:37:44", "minute", 7)</kbd>
	<samp>"18:07:44"</samp>
	The first example here just returns the hour.  Note that it is returned
	as a number, not a string.  In the second example, we change the minute
	to 7 and get the whole time returned in the default ISO-8601
	string format.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"18:38:37".time("Z")</kbd>
	<samp>"02:38:37Z"</samp>
	<kbd>"02:38:37Z".time("")</kbd>
	<samp>"18:38:37"</samp>
	First we convert a time to the UTC time zone with "Z", and then we
	convert the UTC time back to the local timezone with "".
	Note that the date changed for UTC, but we don't see that in the
	<tt>time()</tt> result.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"18:38:37".time("%I:%M%p")</kbd>
	<samp>"02:38PM"</samp>
	This uses a moderately complex strftime() formatting string to generate
	the time in a 12-hour format.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

	<li>Times are "normalized" after a field is changed, to bring all
	    of the fields into their valid ranges.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"00:24:13".time("hour",24)</kbd>
	      <samp>"00:24:13"</samp>
	      Hours can range from 0 to 23.  Setting the hour to 24 makes it
	      be the first hour of the following day, but we don't see the
	      date in the <tt>time()</tt> result.
	    </div>

	<li>C has a <tt>time()</tt> function which is entirely different.
	    C's <tt>time()</tt> returns the current time as a <tt>time_t</tt> number.
	    JsonCalc's <tt>now</tt> variable does that.
      </ul>
