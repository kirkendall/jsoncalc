      <dd>
      This writes <var>data</var> out to <var>filename</var>, or to stdout if you
      don't pass a filename.
      It always returns <tt>null</tt>.
      <p>
      This is an aggregate function, meaning it accumulates the count over a series
      of table elements when used with the @ operator, or a <tt>SELECT</tt> clause.
      You may also pass it an array to have it accumulate results across the elements
      of that array.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run") @ writeArray(this, "run" + run + ".json")</kbd>
	<samp>[]</samp>
	This uses the <tt>test.scores</tt> table from the sample data,
	splits it into groups via the value in the "run" column,
	and then writes each run out to a separate file.
	Each group's <tt>writeArray()</tt> call returns <tt>null</tt>,
	so nothing gets added to the result of the @ operator.
	<p>
	One important note here is that if there were any rows that weren't in a
	group (e.g., if <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=groupBy">groupBy()</a>
	had been called with a second argument to add an overall totals line),
	that would cause trouble.
	It would cause <strong>jsoncalc</strong> to create a fourth aggregating
	sequence for <strong>all</strong> of the table, and hence create a file...
	But that file would have seen <tt>1</tt> in the
	"run" column for the first item, so the file name would have been "run1.json",
	just like the file intended for run 1.

      <ul>

        <li>To be honest, this function exists mostly to show that aggregate functions
	    can be written that are useful for more than just their return value.
            The file is created when the aggregate function starts accumulating data,
            and then each <var>data</var> gets written out as data is accumulated.
            This means it can write an essentially unlimited file size.
