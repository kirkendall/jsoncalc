<b>NAME</b>
        jsoncalc - JSON calculator and reformatter


<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
        <b>jsoncalc</b> [<i>OPTION</i>] [<i>file.jc</i>] [<i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>] [<i>file.json</i>]...


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
        <b>jsoncalc</b> is a tool for examining or modifying JSON data. It can be
        run interactively or in batch mode. It integrates well with shell
        scripts.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
        The typical <b>--help</b> and <b>--version</b> options are supported. Other than
        that, all options are short.

        <b>-c</b><i>command</i>       Apply <i>command</i> to the JSON data. The JSON data will
                        typically come from *.json files also given in the
                        command line. Any results will be written to stdout.
                        This option can be repeated to supply multiple
                        commands to run.

        <b>-f</b><i>scriptfile</i>    Read an expression from a file, and apply it to the
                        JSON data. Again, the JSON data will typically come
                        from *.json files named on the command line. This
                        option can be repeated to supply multiple script
                        files to load. You can also mix it with <b>-c</b><i>command</i> if
                        you want.

                        Also, if the first file named after the last option
                        appears to contain a JsonCalc script instead of JSON
                        data, then it will be loaded like <b>-f</b><i>file.</i>

        <b>-F</b><i>scriptfile</i>    Add <i>scriptfile</i> to a list of scripts to automatically
                        load when running interactively. This is persistent
                        across interactive sessions. Later, to persistently
                        remove a script from that list, you can invoke
                        <b>jsoncalc</b> with a <b>-F-</b><i>scriptfile</i> flag. You can also use
                        lowercase <b>-f-</b><i>scriptfile</i> to temporarily remove
                        <i>scriptfile</i> from the list for a single session.

        <b>-i</b>              Force interactive mode. Usually interactive mode is
                        implied by the lack of <b>-c</b><i>expression,</i> <b>-f</b><i>file</i> or
                        <b>-s</b><i>settings,</i> but if you want to use some of those
                        flags then <b>-i</b> option makes it clear.

        -u              This option allows JsonCalc to update any data files
                        named on the command line, if their data was changed
                        via assignments. This is often used when JsonCalc is
                        constructing JSON documents from other data sources
                        such as environment variables or <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
                        arguments on the shell command line.

        <b>-o</b>|<b>-a</b>           These affect JsonCalc's behavior when trying to load
                        a file that doesn't exist. Normally that's an error,
                        but <b>-o</b> and <b>-a</b> cause it to load missing files as
                        empty objects or arrays, respectively. This can be
                        handy if you're using JsonCalc to construct a JSON
                        document from scratch. You'll usually want <b>-u</b> too.

        <b>-r</b>              Restricted mode. This inhibits some dangerous
                        activities such as invoking an external shell
                        command, or reading/writing files not named on the
                        command line. This software is distributed with no
                        guarantees of any kind. And even if <b>jsoncalc</b> itself
                        is perfect, plugins might not be.

        <b>-d</b><i>directory</i>     Causes any unresolved names in an expression to be
                        interpreted as a request to load <i>dir</i>/<i>name</i>.json as
                        variable <i>name</i>. For example, if you invoke JsonCalc
                        with <b>-d</b><i>foo</i> and then use the name "bar" in an
                        expression, JsonCalc will load foo/bar.json into the
                        "bar" variable. This happens on demand; it doesn't
                        proactively load all files in the "foo" directory
                        into variables.

        <b>-D</b><i>directory</i>     This is like <b>-d</b><i>directory</i> except that uppercase
                        <b>-D</b><i>directory</i> is persistent across interactive
                        sessions. If you want to remove a directory from the
                        persistent list, put a "-" before the directory
                        name, as in <b>-D-</b><i>directory.</i> You can also use lowercase
                        <b>-d-</b><i>directory</i> to temporarily remove it for one
                        session only.

        <b>-j</b><i>flags</i>         Sets debugging flags. <i>flags</i> is a string of letters
                        representing the debugging features to enable. The
                        letters are <b>t</b> to output tokens as they're parsed, <b>f</b>
                        for files as each chunk is read, <b>b</b> to output the
                        remaining buffer, <b>a</b> to call abort() on a JSON error,
                        <b>e</b> to output info for json_by_expr(), or <b>c</b> to output
                        info for json_calc().

        <b>-s</b><i>settings</i>      This controls the output format, colors, and some
                        other features. See the "SETTINGS" section, below.

        <b>-S</b><i>settings</i>      This is like <b>-s</b><i>settings</i> except that uppercase
                        <b>-S</b><i>settings</i> is persistent across interactive
                        sessions.

        <b>-p</b>              A single <b>-p</b> enables pretty-printing, where newlines
                        and whitespace are added to the JSON to show the
                        structure of the data, and is equivalent to
                        <b>-sjson,pretty,oneline=0,noelem</b>. A double <b>-pp</b> is
                        similar but uses <b>elem</b> to cause elements of an array
                        to be output entirely on one line. A triple <b>-ppp</b>
                        outputs compact JSON.

        <b>-l</b><i>plugin</i><b>[,</b><i>settings</i><b>]</b>
                        This loads a plugin. Most plugins are binary files
                        that get linked into <b>jsoncalc</b> at runtime, to provide
                        new functions, commands, file formats, or other
                        features. Some plugins may be implemented in
                        <b>jsoncalc</b>'s scripting language. If a plugin supports
                        settings, then you can set them by appending them
                        after the plugin's name, with a comma as a
                        delimiter.

        <b>-L</b><i>plugin</i><b>[,</b><i>settings</i><b>]</b>
                        This is like <b>-l</b><i>plugin</i><b>,</b><i>settings</i> except that uppercase
                        <b>-L</b><i>plugin</i><b>,</b><i>settings</i> is persistent across interactive
                        sessions. To remove a plugin from the persistent
                        list, use a "-" before the plugin name, as in
                        <b>-L-</b><i>plugin</i><b>.</b> You can also use lowercase <b>-l-</b><i>plugin</i> to
                        temporarily remove a plugin from the persistent list
                        for this session only.

        Note that the uppercase <b>-F</b><i>scriptfile,</i> <b>-D</b><i>directory,</i> <b>-S</b><i>settings,</i> and
        <b>-L</b><i>plugin</i> options are all like their corresponding lowercase option,
        except that the uppercase versions are persistent across interactive
        invocations. This can be very convenient. They intentionally don't
        apply for batch-mode invocations because there you want a consistent
        environment for the script to run in. If a script needs certain
        scripts or plugins to be loaded, it should use an <b>import</b> or <b>plugin</b>
        command to explicitly say so.


<b>INTERACTIVE VS. BATCH MODE</b>
        <b>jsoncalc</b> can run in interactive mode or in batch mode.

        The selection of mode depends on the command-line flags and
        arguments. Using the <b>-i</b> flag always forces interactive mode, but
        without that it tries to guess. If you use <b>-c</b><i>expression,</i> <b>-f</b><i>file,</i>
        <b>-s</b><i>settings,</i> or <b>-p</b> then it will assume batch mode unless you give <b>-i</b>.
        If the first argument after the flags is a script file (not a JSON
        data file) then that counts as a <b>-f</b><i>file</i> flag and will imply batch
        mode unless <b>-i</b> is also used.

        In interactive mode, the first JSON data file named on the command
        line is loaded into a variable named "data". You can use the "file"
        command to switch to other files. If no data files are named on the
        command line, then "data" will be null. Any scripts or commands
        listed on the command line will be executed once, after the first
        file is loaded.

        In batch mode, all data files are loaded, one after the other, and
        any scripts or commands will be executed separately for each one. If
        no data files are named on the command line, and stdin is a file or
        pipe, then <b>jsoncalc</b> will read from stdin and write to stdout.

        Either way, any data files named on the command line will <i>not</i> be
        updated unless you also give a <b>-u</b> flag to enable updates. This
        doesn't affect writing to stdout when no files are named on the
        command line.

        For convenience, interactive sessions can set some flags <b>(-S</b><i>settings,</i>
        <b>-F</b><i>script,</i> and <b>-L</b><i>plugins</i><b>)</b> persistently. If you often need the "csv"
        plugin for your interactive sessions, you can invoke <b>jsoncalc</b> once
        with a <b>-Lcsv</b> flag and then it'll always be loaded for your
        interactive sessions. Later, if you decide you don't want to
        autoload the "csv" plugin, you can remove it from the persistent
        list giving a <b>-L-csv</b> flag.

        In order to provide batch sessions with a consistent runtime
        environment, persistent options <i>do</i><b> </b><i>not</i><b> </b><i>apply</i> to batch sessions.
        Instead, your batch script should use the "set", "import", and
        "plugin" commands to specify what runtime features it needs.

        Except, again for convenience, if stdout is a tty then even batch
        mode will use the persistent settings for the "table", "color", and
        "graphic" options. You can still override this via the <b>-s</b><i>settings</i>
        flag or the "set" command though.


<b>SETTINGS</b>
        The <b>-s</b><i>settings</i> option mostly controls the output format. The <i>settings</i>
        is a series of names or <i>name</i>=<i>value</i> pairs.

        Most settings are boolean. You can turn them on just by giving their
        name, or turn them off by prepending "no" or "-" to the name. For
        example, <b>-spretty</b> will enable pretty-printing, and <b>-snocolor</b> will
        disable colors in the output.

        Some options are strings that have a list of preferred values
        associated with them. You can give just the value, without a name,
        and <b>jsoncalc</b> will figure out which name it belongs to. For example,
        there's a "table" setting with a list of preferred values that
        includes "sh" (for a format that works well on shell scripts), so if
        you want tables to be output in "sh" format, you could either say
        <b>-stable=sh</b> or simply <b>-ssh.</b>

        The main output format options are:
        NAME    TYPE    MEANING
        tab     number  Indentation to add for each layer while pretty-printing.
        oneline number  If &gt;0, JSON data shorter than this won't pretty-print.
        digits  number  Precision when converting floating point to text.
        elem    boolean For top-level arrays, output elements one-per-line.
        table   string  One of csv/sh/grid/json to control table output.
        string  boolean If the output is a string, just output its text.
        pretty  boolean Add whitespace to show the structure of the data.
        color   boolean Enable the use of color on ANSI terminals.
        ascii   boolean Don't output non-ASCII characters; use \uXXXX instead.
        prefix  string  For "sh" output, prepend this to variable names.
        null    string  How to display null in "grid" format.


        Additionally, there are sections to select the color and other
        attributes of certain types of text output. These are whole objects,
        not simple strings/boolean/numbers. The <i>settings</i> parser handles this
        pretty well, though. When setting the value of an object, everything
        up to the next comma or end of the setting is interpreted as a
        space-delimited list of settings within that object. For example,
        you can set the attributes of the column headers in the "grid" table
        output format via a string such as "-sgridhead=italic underlined
        yellow". The "italic" and "underlined" settings are boolean, and
        "yellow" is in the preferred value list for the "fg" (foreground
        color) setting.

        The types of text that can have their attributes set this way
        include <b>result</b> (normal output), <b>error</b> (error messages), <b>debug</b>
        (debugging output), <b>gridhead</b> (column headings in "table=grid"
        format) and <b>gridline</b> (Column separators in "table=grid"). Their
        attributes are:
        bold    boolean Boldface or bright
        dim     boolean Dim
        italic  boolean Italic or oblique
        underlined      boolean A line under the text
        linethru        boolean A line through the midline of the text
        blinking        boolean Nasty blinking text
        fg      string  Foreground color: normal, black, red, green, yellow, blu
e, magenta, cyan, or white
        bg      string  Background color, like "fg" with with "on " prepended, s
uch as "on red"


        Most plugins support options, stored in an object named
        <b>plugin.</b><i>pluginname</i><b>.</b> The preferred way to adjust the settings for a
        plugin is to append the settings after the plugin name when you're
        loading it, though you can also set them via
        <b>-splugin.</b><i>pluginname</i><b>=</b><i>settings</i><b>.</b> The same rules apply for settings in
        these objects, so for example you could specify the "daily" rollover
        method for the "log" plugin via <b>-llog,rollover=daily</b> or <b>-llog,daily</b>
        or <b>-llog -splugin.log=daily.</b>

    <b>SH OUTPUT</b>
        The "sh" table output format deserves a bit more discussion. Each
        row of the table will be output as a line of multiple <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>
        pairs, giving the values for all columns of the table in that row.
        In a shell script, you can read the lines and evaluate them
        one-by-one like this:
            jsoncalc -ssh -c scores sampledata/test.json | while read row
            do
                eval $row
                echo "$name earned $score points in run# $run"
            done

        If you expect the output to be a single object then you can use
        <b>bash</b>(1)'s "$(...)" notation, like this:
            eval $(jsoncalc -ssh -c 'scores[name:"Paul"]' sampledata/test.json)
            echo "$name scored $score"



<b>EXPRESSION SYNTAX</b>
        The expression syntax resembles that of JavaScript expressions, but
        with database-like extensions. For a full description of the syntax,
        see the JsonCalc web page. In short, though, the extensions are:

         * <i>array</i><b>@</b><i>filter</i> and <i>array</i><b>@@</b><i>filter</i> operators to transform arrays.

         * A <i>table</i><b>@=</b><i>table,</i> <i>table</i><b>@&lt;</b><i>table</i> and <i>table</i><b>@&gt;</b><i>table</i> database join
           operators. <b>@=</b> is natural join, <b>@&lt;</b> is left join, and <b>@&gt;</b> is right
           join. A table is simply an array of objects.

         * <i>table</i><b>.orderBy(</b><i>columns</i><b>),</b> <i>table</i><b>.groupBy(</b><i>columns</i><b>),</b>
           <i>array</i><b>.flat(</b><i>depth</i><b>),</b><i>and</i> <i>table</i><b>.unroll</b><i>(</i><b>nest_list</b><i>)</i> functions to
           organize arrays of objects.

         * <i>expr</i><b>.find(</b><i>value</i><b>)</b> to search for a value within a large data
           structure. Also, <i>table</i><b>[</b><i>key:value</i><b>]</b> notation to locate return an
           element from an array of objects, based on the contents of the
           object.

         * Aggregate functions including <i>min(</i><b>expr</b><i>),</i> <i>max(</i><b>expr</b><i>),</i> <i>avg(</i><b>expr</b><i>)</i> and
           <i>count(</i><b>expr</b><i>).</i>

         * A rather full-featured SQL "SELECT" statement.

        JsonCalc also implements many JavaScript operators, functions, and
        commands. It does not support classes though, or functions that
        alter data such as <b>array</b>.splice().

        It <i>does</i> allow you to write functions as though they were member
        functions though. Whenever you write <i>expr.func</i><b>(</b><i>args</i><b>),</b> the <i>expr</i> is
        interpreted as the first argument to <i>func</i><b>().</b> For example,
        <b>"Hello".toUpperCase()</b> and <b>toUpperCase("Hello")</b> are exactly the same
        thing.


<b>INVOCATION EXAMPLES</b>
        jsoncalc        Start <b>jsoncalc</b> interactively, without any JSON data
                        initially.

        jsoncalc<b> </b>-lmath Start <b>jsoncalc</b> interactively, with the "math" plugin
                        loaded. This adds nearly all of the functions and
                        constants from JavaScript's Math class.

        jsoncalc<b> </b>file.json
                        Start <b>jsoncalc</b> interactively using the contents of
                        file.json as variable <b>data.</b>

        jsoncalc<b> </b>-d.    Start <b>jsoncalc</b> interactively. Any *.json files in
                        the directory "." can be accessed simply by using
                        their basename as a variable name, e.g. using the
                        name <i>parts</i> in an expression would load the file
                        <i>./parts.json</i> into the <i>parts</i> variable.

        jsoncalc<b> </b>-p<b> </b>file.json
                        Pretty-print file.json. This is non-interactive
                        because <b>-p</b> was used without <b>-i</b>.

        jsoncalc<b> </b>-c<b> </b>2+2 Start in batch mode, evaluate 2+2 to output 4, and
                        then quit.

        jsoncalc<b> </b>-u<b> </b>script.js<b> </b>data.json<b> </b>data2.json
                        Start in batch mode. For each *.json data file, run
                        the <i>script.js</i> script. Because of the <b>-u</b>, if the
                        script altered any the data from any of the *.json
                        files, they would updated to include those changes.


<b>EXPRESSION EXAMPLES</b>
        The following examples assume you invoked <b>jsoncalc</b> as "jsoncalc
        -dsampledata".

        1+2*3           This outputs 7. <b>jsoncalc</b> makes a pretty decent
                        calculator.

        1..10           Output an array of integers from 1 to 10.

        1..10@{n:this,<b> </b>"n^2":this*this}
                        For each element of the array, construct an object.
                        The @ operator loops over the elements from the left
                        operand (an array) and applies the right operand (an
                        expression) to them with "this" set to the array
                        element's value. The {...} notation is an object
                        generator. The result is an array of objects, which
                        <b>jsoncalc</b> classifies as a table, so it is output as a
                        table.

        2024-12-25<b> </b>+<b> </b>P12D
                        This is an example of ISO-8601 date/time/period
                        calculation. It adds 12 days to Christmas, returning
                        "2025-01-06". <b>jsoncalc</b> makes date calculation easy.
                        (If the strings didn't look like a date and a
                        period, they would have been concatenated just as in
                        JavaScript. If you want to concatenate strings, no
                        questions asked, then use the concat() function.)

        test            Output the contents of sampledata/test.json.

        test.scores     Output the "scores" member of the object loaded from
                        sampledata/test.json. This is a table (array of
                        objects) and the default interactive format is to
                        output tables in a human-readable grid, so it should
                        look pretty.

        test.scores.orderBy(["name","run"])
                        Output the same table, but sorted by name and run.

        test.scores@run==1
                        Only output rows for run 1. The @ and @@ operators
                        take an array as the left operand and an expression
                        on the right to filter the array. If the expression
                        returns a boolean value, then the element is omitted
                        or kept.

        test.scores@{run,score}
                        Only output the "run" and "score" columns. If the
                        right-hand operand of @ or @@ returns a value other
                        than <b>null, true</b> or <b>false</b> then it is used instead of
                        the array's element.

        test.scores.groupBy("run")@{run,avgScore:avg(score)}
                        This groups the records by score, and then computes
                        the average score within each group. <b>avg(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b> is an
                        aggregate function, meaning it first accumulates
                        data across all rows of the data (or all in the
                        group, in this case) and goes back and makes the
                        cumulative result available when evaluating each
                        row. The @ operator only adds one row per group.

        test.scores.groupBy("run","total")@{run,avgScore:avg(score)}
                        The difference here is, groupBy() is passed an extra
                        parameter that causes an extra row to be added for
                        showing the overall average.

        select run, avg(score) from test.scores group by run
                        This uses an SQL "SELECT" command to extract
                        basically the same information. Note that SQL will
                        choose a default name for a computed column.
                        Internally, the SQL "SELECT" is translated to
                        <b>jsoncalc</b>'s native expression syntax so it's about as
                        efficient either way.

        test.scores.groupBy("run")@@{run,avgScore:avg(score)}
                        The difference between @@ and @ is that when groups
                        are used, @ only outputs one value per group while
                        @@ outputs one item per row. In this example, we get
                        a separate copy of each row for each name, even
                        though the name isn't included in the resulting
                        rows.

        test.scores.orderBy("name").groupBy("name")@{name,avgScore:avg(score)}
                        Compute the average score for each name. Note that
                        groupBy() only compares adjacent items when
                        grouping, so we need to explicitly sort by name
                        before we can group by name. This wasn't an issue
                        when grouping by run because the data was already
                        sorted by run.

        test..deepest   This outputs the value of test.deep.deeper.deepest,
                        which happens to be 3. The ".." operator digs down
                        through multiple layers of objects, if necessary, to
                        find the requested name.

        test.cust[0].contact[type:"address"]
                        This looks in <b>text.cust[0].contact</b> (an array of
                        objects) for an element containing a member with the
                        name "type" and value "address".

        test.find(3)    This searches through test for all instances of the
                        value 3, and lists them as a table. You can search
                        for numbers, strings, or regular expressions (search
                        patterns, see regex(7) in the Linux manual).

        emojis          Output the contents of sampledata/emojis.json. If
                        your terminal doesn't display emojis, try one that
                        does. I recommend <b>xfce4-terminal</b>(1) or
                        <b>gnome-terminal</b>(1). KDE's <b>konsole</b>(1) is so-so, and
                        plain old <b>xterm</b>(1) is just bad.

        explain<b> </b>test.cust
                        This examines <b>test.cust</b> (an array of objects) to
                        determine the names, data types, and other
                        information about each member. Basically this is the
                        column information used by the "grid" table output
                        method.


<b>FILES</b>

        ~/.config/jsoncalc/
                        This directory stores JsonCalc's configuration. It
                        may also store temporary files such as caches and
                        logs.

        <i>PATH</i>/lib<i>plugin</i>.so
                        Where <i>PATH</i> is a directory name from $JSONCALCPATH,
                        this is where a binary plugin may be found.

        <i>PATH</i>/<i>plugin</i>.jc  Where <i>PATH</i> is a directory name from $JSONCALCPATH,
                        this is where a script plugin may be found.


<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

        $HOME           This is used to find the <i>~/.config/jsoncalc</i>
                        directory.

        $JSONCALCPATH   This is a list of directories where JsonCalc's
                        supporting files might be found. The default value
                        is derived from $LDLIBRARYPATH.
