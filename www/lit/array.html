    <h1>Array</h1>
    Array generators are represented by square brackets containing a list
    of values.
    In a JSON data file, each value must also be a literal, so the array as
    a whole is a literal, but JsonCalc's array generators are different.
    Their elements can be complex expressions, and the values of those
    expressions can change.
    <p>
    The changeable nature of JsonCalc's arrays are the reason they're called
    "generators" instead of "literals".
    Literals never change, but generators can.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[]</kbd>
	<samp>[]</samp>
        This is the simplest example.  An empty set of brackets returns an
        empty array.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[true,1,"Y",[]]</kbd>
	<samp>[true,1,"Y",[]]</samp>
        Here we're generating an array with four elements.
        Note that the elements can be of different types.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[2+2,CURRENT_TIME]</kbd>
	<samp>[4,"14:04:27"]</samp>
        Here we're generating an array with two elements, both computed.
        "2+2" only uses literals, but it could just as easily have accessed
        a variable, or extracted data from a JSON file.
        "CURRENT_TIME" fetches the current local time in ISO-8601 format.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>You're allowed to place an extra comma after the last item in an
            array generator.
            This is sometimes handy if the code is machine-generated, since
            it means you don't need to make the last generated item be a
            special case.
            It can also save you some aggravation if you rearrange the elements
            manually.
            <div class="example">
              <kbd>[1,2,3,]</kbd>
              <samp>[1,2,3]</samp>
              Here the "3" has an extra comma after it, and that's okay.
