    <h1>Date, Time, DateTime, and Period</h1>
    JSON doesn't have a "Date" class like JavaScript.
    Instead, dates and times are represented by strings.
    JSON documents typically use ISO-8601 formats for dates, times, dateTimes,
    and periods.
    <strong>jx</strong> supports this pretty well.
    <p>
    There are functions and operators for manipulating dates and times.
    Since they're strings, you can also use string functions and operators
    to manipulate them.

    <h2>Dates, Times, and DateTimes</h2>
    Dates are 10-character strings in
    "<var>YYYY</var>-<var>MM</var>-<var>DD</var>" format.
    The hyphens are required.
    Months and days must be zero-padded to fill their 2-character slice of
    the date.
    <p>
    Times are a bit more flexible.
    They're usually "<var>HH</var>:<var>MM</var>:<var>SS</var>",
    but you can also omit the seconds
    ("<var>HH</var>:<var>MM</var>"),
    or include fractions of a second
    ("<var>HH</var>:<var>MM</var>:<var>SS.mmmmmm</var>").
    You can also append a time zone, as described below.
    Without a timezone, the time is assumed to be in the local timezone.
    <p>
    DateTimes combine a date and a time, with a literal letter "T" between them
    ("<var>YYYY</var>-<var>MM</var>-<var>DD</var>T<var>HH</var>:<var>MM</var>:<var>SS</var>")
    and may also contain a timezone.

    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    An empty time zone ("") means the time or dateTime is in your
    local time zone.
    If your area is subject to Daylight Savings Time, then that will affect
    your timezone.
    <p>
    UTC (also known as GMT or Zulu) can be represented by "Z" or "+00:00".
    This is <em>not</em> subject to Daylight Savings Time.
    Many web services use UTC as their preferred time zone.
    <p>
    Other time zones are represented as hours and minutes east of Greenwich,
    in "+hh:mm" or "+hhmm" format.
    If west of Greenwich, this becomes "-hh:mm" or "-hhmm".
    Time zones represented this way are not adjusted for Daylight Savings Time.
    <p>
    Converting a time or dateTime from one time zone to another is easy.
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=time">time()</a> and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=dateTime">dateTime()</a> functions
    accept an optional time zone argument which causes the returned value to
    be expressed in that time zone instead of its original time zone.
    <p>
    ISO-8601 time zone identifiers are different from Unix's.
    Unix-style time zone names such as "PST8PDT" or "America/Los_Angeles"
    are <em>not</em> recognized <strong>jx</strong>.

    <h2>Periods</h2>
    Periods are durations of time, and are represented by strings in
    "P<var>n</var>Y<var>n</var>M<var>n</var>W<var>n</var>DT<var>n</var>H<var>n</var>M<var>n</var>S" format,
    where each <var>n</var> gives the number of years, months, weeks, days,
    hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Note that the number always precedes the unit letter.
    If <var>n</var> is 0 then both the 0 and the following letter should be
    omitted.
    The "T" can be omitted if there are no hours, minutes, or seconds.
    For example, <tt>"P1M"</tt> represents one month, and
    <tt>"PT1H30M"</tt> represents an hour and 30 minutes.
    Numbers are allowed to overflow their intrinsic ranges, for example
    <tt>"PT90M"</tt> also represents an hour and 30 minutes.
    <p>
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=arithmetic">+ and - operators</a>
    can add or subtract a period to/from a date or dateTime.
    You can also subtract one date from another to find the time span between them, expressed as a period.
    Date arithmetic can get messy though.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>isDate("2025-1-1")</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
	<kbd>isDate("2025-01-01")</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        The first example isn't a valid date because the month and day aren't
        zero-padded.
        The second example is properly formatted.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>isDateTime("2025-01-01T00:01:00Z")</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        Here's a dateTime with time zone "Z".
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"2025-02-14" &gt; "2025-01-20"</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
	<kbd>"2025-02-14" - "2025-01-20"</kbd>
	<samp>"P25D"</samp>
	<kbd>"2025-01-20" + "P25D"</kbd>
	<samp>"2025-02-14"</samp>
        The first example shows that ISO-8601 dates can be compared using the
        normal comparison operators.  They'll be compared as strings, but that
        works out thanks to the year-month-date order and mandatory zero-padding.
        The second example does a little date arithmetic, and shows that the
        difference between the two dates is 25 days.
        The final example adds a period to a date, yielding a new date string.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>"2025-01-20T14:00:00-05:00".dateTime("Z")</kbd>
        <samp>"2025-01-20T19:00:00Z"</samp>
        <kbd>"2025-01-20T14:00:00-05:00".dateTime("")</kbd>
        <samp>"2025-01-20T11:00:00"</samp>
        This converts a dateTime from the "-05:00" time zone to UTC time
        (denoted by "Z"), and then to local time (denoted by "").
        Note that the returned dateTime includes the time zone in its text.
        Also, of course, your local time might be different from mine.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Date arithmetic is inherently messy.
            Daylight savings time means days aren't always 24 hours.
            Months aren't always 31 days.
            Years aren't always 365 days.
            <div class="example">
              <kbd>"2024-02-29" + "P1Y"</kbd>
              <samp>"2025-03-01"</samp>
              February 29 is a valid date in 2024, but not 2025 so the date
              gets bumped to March 1.
