    <h1>Environment Variables</h1>
    JsonCalc can access environment variables easily, by prefixing its
    name with a "$".
    For example, $PATH will fetch the value of the PATH environment variable.
    <p>
    Environment variables' values are always strings.
    Never arrays.
    If you need an array of values, the simplest way to handle that is to
    append a subscript to an environment variable's name.
    For example, you might have $file1, $file2, $file3, and so on.
    You could access them in JsonCalc using exactly those same names,
    but you also have the option of using a subscript, such as $file[1].
    The advantage is that the subscript can be computed; the subscript
    expression is evaluated, converted to a string, and appended to the
    given name to produce the full name of the environment variable.
    <p>
    Attempting to fetch the value of an environment variable that doesn't
    exist will return value <tt>null</tt>.
    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=assign">=??</a> assignment
    command and <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=colon">:??</a>
    object generator notation are sensitive to <tt>null</tt>.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>$COLUMNS</kbd>
	<samp>"80"</samp>
        Fetch the value of the $COLUMNS environment variable.
        On many systems, this is the character width of the terminal.
        Note that it is returned as a string, though, so you might want to 
        use <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=parseInt">parseInt()</a>
        to convert it to a number.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>1 .. 10 @ $file[this]</kbd>
        <samp>["foo", "bar", "tmp"]</samp>
	Collect the values of $file1 through $file10 into an array.
	Unset values are omitted by the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a> operator, so we only get three filenames.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Environment variables are usually managed via a shell such as
            <var>bash</var> in Linux/Unix.
            Shells usually access variables' values, including those of
            environment variables, by prefixing the name with $ too.

	<li>The <var>bash</var> shell has its own way of dealing with arrays,
	    but it doesn't carry over to environment variables.
	    JsonCalc's subscripting is entirely different from <var>bash</var>'s.

	<li>You can also use <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=getenv">getenv(expr)</a> to fetch the value of an environment variable.
	   That can be handy when you want to compute the whole name of the
	   variable, instead of just the tail end of it.
      </ul>
