    <h1>Names</h1>
    Names (also called "keys") aren't literals.
    They're about as close as you can get to the opposite of a literal.
    They are used to access variables, or members or objects.
    <p>
    Names follow one of three basic formats:
    <ul>
      <li>An unquoted name must start with an underscore or letter.
          The rest of the name may contain any combination of letters, digits,
          or underscores.
          This is the usually most convenient format, though it's also the
          most constrained.
          Also, there's a chance that the definition of "letter" may vary
          from one computer to another, so I suggest you limit yourself to
          ASCII letters in unquoted names.
      <li>Backtick-quoted names.
          These may contain any character except another backtick.
          This notation is inherited from SQL.
      <li>String-like names, enclosed in double-quotes or single-quotes.
          This only works after a
          <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=dot">.</a> operator, or
          before a <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=colon">:</a> operator;
          in any other context, it'll be treated like a string literal instead of a name.
          Note that JSON text <em>always</em> double-quotes member names like this.
    </ul>

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>var a = 4;<br/>`a`</kbd>
	<samp>4</samp>
	<kbd>"a"</kbd>
	<samp>"a"</samp>
        First we define a variable named <tt>a</tt> (unquoted) and set it to 4.
        Then we access <tt>a</tt> (backtick-quoted) and its the same variable
        so we get 4.
        Finally, we try using double-quoted "a" but because we aren't after
        a . operator or before a : operator, it's just a string.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>{"b":true}</kbd>
        <samp>{"b":true}</samp>
        <kbd>{"b":true}."b"</kbd>
        <samp>true</samp>
        Here we use a double-quoted name before a colon and after a dot,
        and it is indeed interpreted as a name instead of a string.
      </div>
