    <h1>Numbers</h1>
    Numbers are written in the usual way &mdash;
    an optional "-",
    then some digits (optionally with a "." mixed in),
    and optionally an "e" or "E" followed by an exponent.
    Integers can also be written in hex with a "0x" prefix,
    octal with a "0o" or "0" prefix, or
    binary with a "0b" prefix.
    <p>
    One unusual thing about JsonCalc is that number literals parsed from
    JSON documents are stored internally as text and only converted to
    binary when necessary.
    Computed numbers, and most literals parsed in a script (not JSON data)
    are stored in binary and only converted to text when outputting.
    There are two reasons for this.
    <ul>
      <li>Converting between text and binary formats is slow; there is no
          CPU hardware that does it instantly like most floating point
          operations.  Often in a large JSON document, most numbers are
          never accessed, and the ones that are will usually just
          be copied verbatim to the output.  Let's save some time by not
          converting them.
      <li>The process of floating point conversion loses precision.
          Once a floating point number has been converted to binary,
          you want it to stay binary as long as possible
          for the sake of precision,
          and only be converted back to text when it's being output.
    </ul>

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>1.2e2</kbd>
	<samp>1.2e2</samp>
	<kbd>1.2e2 + 0</kbd>
	<samp>120</samp>
        The first example shows that numbers aren't converted to/from binary
        unless they have to be.
        In the second example, it has to be converted so we can perform math
        on it, and then convert it back for output.
        Both examples return the same number, but the first leaves the number
        formatted as it was found, while the second one formats it the way
        JsonCalc wants.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[0x10, 10, 010, 0b10]</kbd>
	<samp>[16, 10, 8, 2]</samp>
	This example shows integers in various formats.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summar>
      <ul>
        <li>JSON only supports decimal numbers.
            You can use hex/octal/binary literals in scripts,
            but not in JSON data.
	<li>The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=parseInt">parseInt()</a>
	    function can't handle hex/octal/binary either.
      </ul>
