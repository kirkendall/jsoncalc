    <h1>Objects</h1>
    Object generators are represented by a pair of curly braces containing
    a comma-delimited list of key:value pairs.
    This is similar to JSON objects, and identical to JavaScript objects.
    <p>
    Unlike JSON, the member keys (names) don't need to be enclosed in quotes,
    although that is allowed.
    Another difference from JSON and similarity to JavaScript is that
    the values can be any expression, not just a literal.
    Consequently, the object returns may vary if variables vary.
    This is why we're talking about "object generators" instead of
    "object literals".
    <p>
    Also, you can omit the key and colon, and just write the value.
    When you do this, the source text of the value is used as the key.
    The most common use of this is to copy a variable into an object &mdash;
    just put the variable's name in the curly braces, and its name and value
    will be used as the member's key and value respectively.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{}</kbd>
	<samp>{}</samp>
	Any empty object.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{x:2,"y":7.7}</kbd>
	<samp>{"x":1,"y":7.7}</samp>
        An object with two members.
        I enclosed the second one's key in quotes just to show that quotes
        are entirely optional; use them or don't as you see fit.
        JSON always uses quotes around keys though, as you see in the output.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>var x=2, y=3;<br/>{x,y,z:0,x-y}</kbd>
	<samp>{"x":2,"y":3,"z":0,"x-y":-1}</samp>
	An object with four members.
	This time, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are set from variables, taking on
	both their names/keys and their values.
	The <tt>z</tt> member is explicitly set to 0.
	In the last one, we're omitting the key-colon again so the source text
	is used as the key even though it doesn't look like a name.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>It's worth pointing out that any JSON object is also a
            syntactically-correct JsonCalc object generator.
            You can copy any chunk of JSON data into a JsonCalc script and
            have it work as intended.

        <li>JavaScript's object notation doesn't allow you to omit the
            key-colon.
            That's purely a JsonCalc feature.
