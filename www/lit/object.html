    <h1>Objects</h1>
    Object generators are represented by a pair of curly braces containing
    a comma-delimited list of key:value pairs.
    This is similar to JSON objects, and identical to JavaScript objects.
    <p>
    Unlike JSON, the member keys (names) don't need to be enclosed in quotes,
    although that is allowed.
    Another difference from JSON and similarity to JavaScript is that
    the values can be any expression, not just a literal.
    Consequently, the object returned may vary if variables vary.
    This is why we're talking about "object generators" instead of
    "object literals".
    <p>
    JsonCalc also allows you to use ":??" instead of ":" to conditionally
    add/assign a member only if the value is not null.
    If you're using a JsonCalc script to assemble data from another source,
    this makes it easy to add members to the result only if we have a value
    to stuff into that member.
    <p>
    Also, you can omit the key and colon, and just write the value.
    When you do this, the source text of the value is used as the key.
    The most common use of this is to copy a variable into an object &mdash;
    just put the variable's name in the curly braces, and its name and value
    will be used as the member's key and value respectively.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{}</kbd>
	<samp>{}</samp>
	Any empty object.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{x:2,"y":7.7}</kbd>
	<samp>{"x":1,"y":7.7}</samp>
        An object with two members.
        I enclosed the second one's key in quotes just to show that quotes
        are entirely optional; use them or don't as you see fit.
        JSON always uses quotes around keys though, as you see in the output.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>var x=2, y=3;</kbd>
	<kbd>{x,y,z:0,x-y}</kbd>
	<samp>{"x":2,"y":3,"z":0,"x-y":-1}</samp>
	An object with four members.
	This time, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are set from variables, taking on
	both their names/keys and their values.
	The <tt>z</tt> member is explicitly set to 0.
	In the last one, we're omitting the key-colon again so the source text
	is used as the key even though it doesn't look like a name.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.cust @ {name, joined, contacts: contact.length}</kbd>
        <samp><table>
<tr><th>name</th><th>joined</th><th>contacts</th></tr>
<tr><td>Peter</td><td>2024-01-02</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paul</td><td>2023-10-15</td>td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mary</td><td>2022-08-09</td>td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ziggy</td><td>2023-04-17</td>td>2</td></tr>
</table>
	</samp>
	This scans <tt>test.cust</tt> (part of the sample data) and builds
	a new object for each entry, containing just the <tt>name</tt> and
	<tt>joined</tt> members, plus a count of the contact methods.


      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{x:??x, y:??y, z:??z}</kbd>
	<samp>{"x":2,"y":3}</samp>
	Here we're constructing an object from the <tt>x<tt>, <tt>y</tt>,
	and <tt>z</tt> variables, except that <tt>z</tt> doesn't exist so it
	is effectively <tt>null</tt>.
	The use of "<tt>:??</tt>" instead of "<tt>:</tt>" means that
	<tt>null</tt> values are omitted, so the resulting object contains
	<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> members but no <tt>z</tt> member.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>It's worth pointing out that any JSON object is also a
            syntactically-correct JsonCalc object generator.
            You can copy any chunk of JSON data into a JsonCalc script and
            have it work as intended.

        <li>Although JsonCalc is case-insensitive, you can still define objects
            with members whose names differ only in case.
            When searching for a member within an object,
            JsonCalc first tries to find it using a case-sensitive search.
            If that fails, then it tries a case-insensitive search.
            <div class="example">
	      <kbd>var obj = {"key":"metal thing", "Key":"Francis Scott"}</kbd>
	      <kbd>obj.key</kbd>
	      <samp>"metal thing"</samp>
	      <kbd>obj.Key</kbd>
	      <samp>"Francis Scott"</samp>
	      <kbd>obj.KEY</kbd>
	      <samp>"metal thing"</samp>
	      The first two member searches find the correct member using a
	      case-sensitive search.
	      The third example must fall back on the case-insensitive search.
            </div>

        <li>JavaScript's object notation doesn't allow you to omit the
            key-colon.
            That's purely a JsonCalc feature.

	<li>In addition to the
	    JavaScript-like <var>key</var>:</var>value</var> notation,
	    you can also use an
	    SQL-like <var>value</var> <b>AS</b> <var>key</var> notation.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>{x + y as sum}</kbd>
	      <samp>{"sum":5}</samp>
	    </div>

      </ul>
