    <h1>Regular expressions</h1>
    Regular expressions are a standard way to describe complex text patterns.
    JsonCalc uses them with the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=like">LIKE</a> operator, and the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=replace">replace()</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=split">split()</a> and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=find">find()</a> functions.
    <p>
    Regular expressions are enclosed in / (slash) characters, and may be
    followed by <tt>i</tt> and/or <tt>g</tt> flags.
    The / character is also used as the division operator, but context
    allows the parser to figure it out.
    Regular expressions are really only used after a ( or , character,
    or after the LIKE operator.
    The <tt>i</tt> flag makes the regular expression be case-insensitive;
    without it, comparisons and searches would be case-sensitive.
    The <tt>g</tt> flag can be used with the <tt>replace()</tt> function to
    replace all matching instances within a string; without <tt>g</tt>,
    <tt>replace()</tt> would only replace the first match.
    <p>
    For a full description of the regular expression syntax,
    see the Linux manual (i.e., run "man 7 regex").
    The highlights are:
    <ul>
      <li>Most characters match only themselves.  This include letters, digits,
          and whitespace.
      <li>A <tt>^</tt> at the start of the regular expression means it can
          only match text at the start of the target string.
      <li>A <tt>$</tt> at the end of the regular expression means it can only
          match text at the end of the target string.
      <li>The <tt>.</tt> character matches any single character.
      <li><tt>[ ]</tt> encloses sets of characters.  This will match a single
          character from the test string, if it's in the set.
          The brackets can contain single characters, or pairs separated by
          a hyphen for a range of characters.
          For example <kbd>[a-zA-Z0-9]</kbd> matches any single ASCII letter or digit.
          There are also named sets, which are maybe more readable and more
          importantly handle non-ASCII characters too.  For example,
          <kbd>[[:alpha:]]</kbd> matches any letter, including non-ASCII letters.
      <li>The <tt>*</tt> character is a "closure operator" which means it
          affects how often the expression before it
          (often just a single character) may be repeated.
          For <tt>*</tt> it can be repeated zero or more times.  One common
	  example is <tt>.*</tt> which matches any text at all.
	  (That means any character, repeated any number of times).
      <li><tt>\+</tt> is a closure operator that means the preceding expression
          should repeat 1 or more times.
      <li><tt>\?</tt> is a closure operator that means the preceding expression 	  should occur 0 or 1 times; i.e. that it is optional.
      <li><tt>\( \)</tt> marks subexpressions.
          These affect closure operators like <tt>*</tt> and <tt>\+</tt>,
          allowing them to match multi-character expressions.
          Also, the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=replace">replace()</a> function can access the
          text that matched each subexpression and use it when constructing
          replacement text.
    </ul>

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>/foo/</kbd>
	<samp>null</samp>
	This was correctly parsed as a regular expression, but
	regular expressions don't work by themselves; they must be part of a
	function call or operator invocation.
	So the result is <tt>null</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"food" like /foo/</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        This returns <tt>true</tt> because "food" does contain f-o-o.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"food" like /^foo$/</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
        This returns <tt>false</tt> because the <tt>$</tt> means the target
        string isn't allowed to have any text after the matching text, but
        "food" has a "d" after the matching text.  No good.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Since JsonCalc deals strictly with JSON data,
            and regular expressions aren't a valid JSON data type,
            I had to get clever.
            Regular expressions are handled like <tt>null</tt> except they
            also have sort of a side-channel where the regular expression
            is stored.
            When evaluating an expression, if a regular expression is used
            where it is expected (the LIKE operator or <tt>replace()</tt>
            function, basically) then the regular expression is seen and
            used; in any other context, the regular expression is just
            <tt>null</tt>.

	<li>One consequence of the above is that regular expressions can't
	    be stored in a var or const.

      </ul>
