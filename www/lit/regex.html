    <h1>Regular expressions</h1>
    Regular expressions are a standard way to describe complex text patterns,
    JsonCalc uses them with the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=like">LIKE</a> operator, and the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=replace">replace()</a> function.
    <p>
    Regular expressions are enclosed in / (slash) characters, and may be
    followed by <tt>i</tt> and/or <tt>g</tt> flags.
    The / character is also used as the division operator, but context
    allows the parser to figure it out.
    Regular expressions are really only used after a ( or , character,
    or after the LIKE operator.
    The <tt>i</tt> flag makes the regular expression be case-insensitive;
    without it, comparisons and searches would be case-sensitive.
    The <tt>g</tt> flag can be used with the <tt>replace()</tt> function to
    replace all matching instanges within a string; without <tt>g</tt>,
    <tt>replace()</tt> would only replace the first match.
    <p>
    For a full description of the regular expression syntax,
    see the Linux manual (i.e., run "man 7 regex").
    The highlights are:
    <ul>
      <li>Most character match only themselves.  This include letters, digits,
          and whitespace.
      <li>A ^ at the start of the regular expression means it can only match
          text at the start of the target string.
      <li>A $ at the end of the regular expression means it can only match
          text at the end of the target string.
      <li>The . character matches any single character except newline.
      <li>Square brackets enclose sets of characters.  This will match a single
          character from the test string, if its in the set.
      <li>Parentheses mark subexpressions.  These affect closure operators
          like * and +.  Also, the <tt>replace()</tt> function can access the
          text that matched each subexpression and use it when constructing
          replacement text.
      <li>* means the character or subexpression before it may occur
          zero or more times (repeated).
    </ul>

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>/foo/</kbd>
	<samp>null</samp>
	This was correctly parsed as a regular expression, but
	regular expressions don't work by themselves; they must be part of a
	function call or operator invocation.
	So the result is <tt>null</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"food" like /foo/</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        This returns <tt>true</tt> because "food" does contain f-o-o.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"food" like /^foo$/</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
        This returns <tt>false</tt> because the <tt>$</tt> means the target
        string isn't allowed to have any text after the matching text, but
        "food" has a "d" after the matching text.  No good.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Since JsonCalc deals strictly with JSON data,
            and regular expressions aren't a valid JSON data type,
            I had to get clever.
            Regular expressions are handled like <tt>null</tt> except they
            also have sort of a side-channel where the regular expression
            is stored.
            When evaluating an expression, if a regular expression is used
            where it is expected (the LIKE operator or <tt>replace()</tt>
            function, basically) then the regular expression is seen and
            used; in any other context, the regular expression is just
            <tt>null</tt>.

	<li>One consequence of the above is that regular expressions can't
	    be stored in variables.
