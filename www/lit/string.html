    <h1>Strings</h1>
    Strings represent any character data, in UTF-8 encoding.
    <p>
    They are <em>not</em> chunks of binary data.
    Only Unicode characters using UTF-8 encoding are allowed.
    <p>
    They may be enclosed in single quotes (apostrophes, \x27) or
    double quotes (\x22).  When output, they'll always use double quotes
    because that's standard for JSON.
    <p>
    Several escapes are allowed within the quotes, mostly to handle things
    that would be awkward in ASCII.
    These are:
    <table>
      <tr><td>\\</td><td>A single literal backslash character, \x5c</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\"</td><td>A double-quote character, \x27</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\'</td><td>A single-quote character, \x22</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\0</td><td>An ASCII NUL character, \x00</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\b</td><td>A backspace control character, \x08</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\e</td><td>An ASCII escape control character, \x1b</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\f</td><td>A formfeed control character, \x0c</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\r</td><td>A carriage-return control character, \x0d</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\n</td><td>A newline (linefeed) control character, \x0a.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\t</td><td>A tab control character, \x09</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\u<var>XXXX</var></td><td>A hex-encoded UTF-16 character</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\u{<var>XXXXXX</var>}</td><td>A hex-encoded UTF-32 character</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\U<var>XXXXXXXX</var></td><td>A hex-encoded UTF-32 character.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>\x<var>XX</var></td><td>A hex-encoded character from the first 256 Unicode characters.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    JsonCalc always uses UTF-8 encoding for text.
    It allows entry of UTF-16 or UTF-32 characters via \u<var>XXXX</var>
    and \U<var>XXXXXXXX</var>, but converts those characters to the
    corresponding UTF-8 byte sequences.
    It even understands and converts UTF-16 "surrogate pairs" to gain
    access to extended Unicode characters such as emoji.
    <p>
    Internally, a 0x00 byte is used to mark the end of strings.
    To allow '\0' to represent an ASCII NUL character without prematurely
    marking the end of a string, internally '\0' is represented by a
    Unicode U+ffff character.
    This is a special Unicode character that should never be stored as part
    of a document but programs can use it internally for things like this.
    This substitution is used in all functions except
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=hex">hex()</a> which can
    reveal the "efbfbf" UTF-8 byte sequence for the U+ffff Unicode codepoint.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"\U1f4a3".length</kbd>
	<samp>1</samp>
        This is the UTF-32 escape for the "bomb" emoji.
        That's a single character, so the length is 1.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"\U1f4a3" = "\ud83d\udca3"</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        The bomb emoji again.
        This time we're comparing the UTF-32 escape for the bomb emoji
        to the UTF-16 surrogate pair for the bomb emoji.
        They're the same thing;
        the internal UTF-8 encodings for both strings are identical.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"\0"</kbd>
	<samp>"\0"</samp>
	<kbd>"\0".charCodeAt()</kbd>
	<samp>0</samp>
	<kbd>fromCharCode(0)</kbd>
	<samp>"\0"</samp>
	<kbd>"\0".hex()</kbd>
	<samp>"efbfbf"</samp>
	Some experiments with the "\0" character.
	Outwardly it looks like an ASCII NUL byte, but the 
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=hex">hex()</a> function
        reveals that internally it's stored as U+ffff ("efbfbf" in UTF-8).
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>For \U<var>XXXXXXXX</var>, \u<var>XXXX</var>, and \x<var>XX</var>,
            you don't need to type all hex digits.  The highest Unicode
            character is \U10ffff and you can write it like that without
            any leading zeroes.

	<li>When outputting Unicode text in ASCII format
	    (via the -sascii command-line flag),
	    UTF-16 escapes will be used, including surrogate pairs where needed.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>set ascii</kbd>
	      <kbd>"\U1f4a3"</kbd>
	      <samp>"\ud83d\udca3"</samp>
	      Even though we entered the "bomb" emoji using UTF-32 notation,
	      when output in ASCII it is converted to a UTF-16 surrogate pair.
	    </div>

	<li>Unicode tables often show code points in a "U+<var>XXXXX</var>"
	    notation.  This corresponds to JsonCalc's "\u{<var>XXXXX</var>}"
	    or "\U<var>XXXXX</var>" notation.

      </ul>
