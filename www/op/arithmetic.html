    When applied to numbers, these are the usual arithmetic operators,
    with the usual precedences.
    The <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> operators also work with strings, and
    ISO 8601 date/datetime/period values.
    <p>
    Operator precedence is the same regardless of the type of data they're
    applied to.
    
    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    There are no real surprises for numbers.  They work on floating point
    numbers except for <tt>%</tt> which works on integers.
    
    <h2>Strings</h2>
    When applied to strings, the <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> operators
    contatentate them.
    <tt>+</tt> contatenates them without any other changes, while
    <tt>-</tt> leaves exactly one space between them.
    <p>
    Combining a string with <tt>null</tt> simply returns the string unchanged.
    This way, you can combine strings even if some of the strings are sometimes
    missing.

    <h2>Dates and Periods</h2>
    <strong>jx</strong> represents dates, datetimes, and periods as
    strings in ISO 8601 format.
    Although they're strings, the <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> operators don't
    concatenate them.
    Instead, it adds a period to a date or datetime, or subtracts a period
    from a date or datetime, and returns the result as a new date or datetime
    string.
    <p>
    You can also subtract one date or datetime from another, and get the
    difference as a period.
    ISO 8601 is vague about negative periods, so you'll probably be happier
    if the left date/datetime comes after the right date/datetime.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>2 + 2</kbd>
	<samp>4</samp>
	<kbd>1 + 2 * 3</kbd>
	<samp>7</samp>
	<kbd>22 / 7</kbd>
	<samp>3.14286</samp>
	<kbd>(9 * 60 + 30) * 60 + 18</kbd>
	<samp>34218</samp>
        Yes, <strong>jx</strong> is a decent calculator.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Json" + "Calc"</kbd>
	<samp>"jx"</samp>
        As in JavaScript,
        the <tt>+</tt> operator does double-duty as a string concatenation operator.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Howard" - "" - "Johnson"</kbd>
	<samp>"Howard Johnson"</samp>
	<kbd>"Howard" - null - "Johnson"</kbd>
	<samp>"Howard Johnson"</samp>
	These three strings are concatenated with spaces between them.
	The <tt>-</tt> operator is smart enough to avoid double spaces where
	empty strings are involved.
	It also skips over <tt>null</tt>, such as when one of the strings
	is missing.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"layer"+2+1</kbd>
	<samp>"layer21"</samp>
	<kbd>"layer"+(2+1)</kbd>
	<samp>"layer3"</samp>
	Mixing strings with numbers is allowed; the numbers are converted to strings.
	The mixture is no longer associative though, so you might need to add parentheses.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"2024-01-15" + "P1M"</kbd>
	<samp>"2024-02-15"</samp>
	<kbd>"2024-01-15" - "P1M"</kbd>
	<samp>"2023-12-15"</samp>
        Some examples with dates and periods.
        In the second example, changing the month also caused the year to change.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"2024-12-31" - "P1M"</kbd>
	<samp>"2024-12-01"</samp>
        Here's an example showing how date arithmetic can get messy.
        You might expect the result to be <tt>"2024-11-31"</tt> but that
        isn't a valid date since there are only 30 days in November,
        so it gets rounded up to the first day of the following month.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>"2025-01-04" - "2025-01-01"</kbd>
        <samp>"P3D"</samp>
        Finding the difference between two dates.
        Here, the difference is 3 days.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript doesn't use <tt>-</tt> for concatenation with spaces.
            That's purely a jx thing.
	<li>JavaScript also doesn't have much in the way of date arithmetic
	    either.  It represents datetimes as Date objects, which don't
	    have anything like addition.  However, if you use setMonth() and
	    setDate() to set a date to November 31 then it'll actually get set
	    to December 1, just as in the above "messy" example.
	<li>To concatenate strings, there are also
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=concat">concat()</a>
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=join">join()</a>
	    functions which <em>do not</em> attempt to treat ISO-8601
	    date/time/period strings specially; they just concatenates them.
	    <tt>concat()</tt> takes any number of strings as arguments and
	    concatenates them with no delimiters added.
	    <tt>join()</tt> takes an array of strings and optionally a delimiter
	    (defaulting to ",").
	<li>Date/datetime/period arithmetic is stable for small units
	    (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
	    The date messiness is worst when you try to add/subtract months
	    after the 28th day of the month.
	    Years are only a problem if leap days are involved.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"2024-02-29" + "P1Y"</kbd>
	      <samp>"2025-03-01"</samp>
	      There is no February 29 in 2025, so it gets rounded to March 1.
	    </div>
	<li>If a date/datetime/period is malformed, then it will be treated like
	    any other string &mdash; the <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> operators
	    will concatenate them.
	<li>When the "-" operator is applied to two date strings then the
	    difference will be rounded to the nearest number of whole days.
	    This is significant when the two dates straddle a daylight savings
	    time change.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>"2026-08-06" - "2025-11-20"</kbd>
	      <samp>"P259D"</samp>
	      <kbd>"2026-08-06T00:00:00" - "2025-11-20T00:00:00"</kbd>
	      <samp>"P258DT23H"</samp>
	      The first example uses dates, and we see that the difference
	      between them is 259 days.
	      In the second example we use datetimes, and the answer isn't
	      exactly the same because daylight savings time took away one hour.
	    </div>
