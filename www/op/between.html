    This is a ternary (three-operand) operator inherited from SQL.
    It is effectively the same as a pair of comparisons.
    It can work on numbers or strings.
    When comparing strings,
    the comparison will be case-insensitive since that's SQL convention.
    <p>
    If you mix strings and numbers, then the strings will be converted to
    numbers, and then the numbers will be compared.
    If a string can't be converted to a number then the operator returns
    <tt>false</tt>.

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>2 between 4 and 10</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
	<kbd>7 between 4 and 10</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        No surprises.  Note that the "and" here is part of the "between" operator,
        and is <strong>not</strong> a logical-and.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>SELECT * FROM test.scores WHERE score BETWEEN 30 AND 40</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>name</th><th>run</th><th>score</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>1</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>2</td><td>35</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>3</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>3</td><td>40</td></tr>

	Here we see the <tt>BETWEEN</tt> operator in its native habitat.
	This also shows that the limits are included in the range.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>If the expression being tested is complicated, then <tt>BETWEEN</tt>
            might be more efficient than a pair of <tt>&lt;=</tt>/<tt>&gt;=</tt>
            comparisons, because <tt>BETWEEN</tt> only needs to compute the value
            once.
