    For integer operands, these perform bitwise logic operations.
    That's pretty standard, so I won't go into it much.
    <p>
    You can also use these operators on objects.
    They treat the objects' member keys like sets.
    Specifically...
      <dt><var>object</var> &amp; <var>object</var>
      <dd>The resulting object will contain members whose keys appear in both
	  the left and right operands.
	  The values of the left object's members are used in the new object;
	  the values of the right object's members are irrelevant.

      <dt><var>object</var> | <var>object</var>
      <dd>The resulting object will contain members whose keys appear in either
	  the left or right operands.
	  If a key appears in both operands, then the value of the right operand
	  is used in the resulting object.

      <dt><var>object</var> ^ <var>object</var>
      <dd>The resulting object will contain the keys and values from the left
	  operand, except that if the right operand has a key with the same name
	  then it is omitted from the result object.
	  This is effectively subtraction.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>~0</kbd>
	<samp>-1</samp>
        On most computers, the all-1's bit pattern corresponds to -1.
        (In case the typography isn't clear, that's "tilde zero" and "minus one".)
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>37 &amp; 1</kbd>
	<samp>1</samp>
        The 1's bit of 37 is set.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>33 | 65</kbd>
	<samp>97</samp>
	33 has 1's and 32's bits set, 65 has 1's and 64's bits set, so their
	bitwise-OR has 1's, 32's, and 64's set.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{a:"left",b:"left"} &amp; {a:"right",c:"right"}</kbd>
	<samp>{"a":"left"}</samp>
	Intersection.
	The result can only contain members whose keys (names) appear in both
	operands; in this case, that's just the "a" member.
	The value of the left operand's "a" is kept in the result.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{a:"left",b:"left"} | {a:"right",c:"right"}</kbd>
	<samp>{"a":"right","b":"left","c":"right"}</samp>
	Union.
	The result object contains members that appear in either operand.
	If it appears in both, then the value from the right operand is used in the
	result.
	That means "a" and "c" have the values from the right operand, but the
	"b" is also in the result using the value from the left operand.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{a:"left",b:"left"} ^ {a:"right",c:"right"}</kbd>
	<samp>{"b":"left"}</samp>
	Subtraction.
	Since the right operand contains "a", that is deleted from the left operand
	to produce the result.
	The "c" member of the right operand has no effect since the left operand
	already has no "c".
	The values of the right operand's members are irrelevant.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.scores @ this | {histogram: "%".repeat(score)}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>name</th><th>run</th><th>score</th><th>histogram</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>1</td><td>10</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>1</td><td>30</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>2</td><td>25</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>2</td><td>35</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>3</td><td>30</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>3</td><td>25</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td>3</td><td>40</td><td>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	The <tt>|</tt> operator is particularly handy for adding columns to tables.
	Here we're looping over the <tt>test.scores</tt> table from the sample data.
	The subexpression on the right of the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=each">@</a>
	gets evaluated for each row, with <tt>this</tt> set to the row's object.
	We're adding a "histogram" column, formed by repeating "%" to reflect
	<tt>this.score</tt>.
	<p>
	The fact that the "grid" display format for tables happens to use the "|"
	character as a column delimiter is just a happy coincidence.

        <li>The ~ (tilde, "bitwise not") operator doesn't work with objects.
