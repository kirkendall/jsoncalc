    This returns the first non-<tt>null</tt> operand.
    Often you'll use a whole series of <tt>??</tt> operators with values,
    as a prioritized list of possibilities to return.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.contact.cell ?? test.contact.email ?? test.contact.home</kbd>
	<samp>"mycontact@sample.com"</samp>
        In the sample data, <tt>test.contact</tt> has no "cell" member, but it does
        have "email" so we get that.
	It also has a "home" member, but since we found "email" we don't need "home".
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>This uses "short circuit" evalulation, meaning the right operand
            isn't evaluated if the left operand is non-<tt>null</tt>.

	<li>JavaScript has this too!

	<li>JsonCalc also has an <tt>=??</tt> assignment operator which only
	    assigns if the new value wouldn't be <tt>null</tt>, and a
	    <tt>:??</tt> notation in object generators to only add members
	    if the value would not be <tt>null</tt>.
	    JavaScript does <em>not</em> have these.

      </ul>
