    <table class="opList">
      <tr><td class="left">object</td><td class="op">.</td><td class="right">key</td><td class="opdesc">Access a member of an object by key (name)</td></tr>

    </table>
    The <tt>.</tt> operator lets you access a member of an object by its key (name).
    <p>
    The <tt>..</tt> operator is similar but it does "deep" lookup,
    meaning if the object doesn't have a member with the given key but
    does contain members whose values are objects, then it will search for the
    key in those objects too.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.deep</kbd>
	<samp>{"deeper":{"deepest":3,"deeply":"madly"},"dept":"transportation"}</samp>
        <tt>test</tt> refers to the "test.json" table in the sample data.
        Here we're accessing the <tt>deep</tt> member of the object in that file.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.deep.deeper.deepest</kbd>
	<samp>3</samp>
	<kbd>test..deepest</kbd>
	<samp>3</samp>
        First we use a series of <tt>.</tt> operators to navigate down through a
        series of nested objects.
        Then we get the same result using the <tt>..</tt> operator once.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The <var>object</var><tt>..</tt><var>key</var> operator is only
            smart about descending into nested objects.
            It is not smart enough to scan arrays for a match.
      </ul>
