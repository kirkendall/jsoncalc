    <h1>Array filter operators</h1>
    <table class="opList">
      <tr><td class="left">array</td><td class="op">@</td><td class="right">expr</td><td class="opdesc">Array filtering, returns 1 per group</td></tr>
      <tr><td class="left">array</td><td class="op">@@</td><td class="right">expr</td><td class="opdesc">Array filtering, returns 1 per row</td></tr>
    </table>
    These two operators loop over the elements of their left argument (an array),
    process each one individually via the expression of the right argument, and
    collect the results in a new array which is the final result of the operator.
    <p>
    The only difference between <tt>@</tt> and <tt>@@</tt> is that if you divide
    the array into groups (by embedding sub-arrays within the array (e.g. via the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=groupBy">groupBy()</a> function)
    then <tt>@</tt> will include one result per group,
    while <tt>@@</tt> returns a result for each element of each group.
    <p>
    So the right operand gets evalated a lot.
    Usually once for each array element.
    While it is being evaluated, the <tt>this</tt> variable is set to the element's value
    so you can access it just by using the name <tt>this</tt>.
    If the element is an object, then the member's objects can be accessed just by
    giving their name; you don't need to say <tt>this.name</tt>
    (although that works too).
    <p>
    The result of the right operand expression is interpreted as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>If the right hand expression is <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, nothing
          gets appended to the result array.
      <li>If the right hand expression is <tt>true</tt>, then the element from the
          left operand gets appended to the result without any changes.
      <li>Anything else gets appended to the result instead of the left operand's
          element.
    </ul>
    So the first two rules let you selectively remove items from the result, while
    the last one lets you generate new result elements from the left operand elements.
    <p>
    These operators support aggregate functions such as
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=count">count()</a> and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=max">max()</a>.
    If the right operand uses any aggregate functions, then it will loop over the
    array elements twice &mdash; once to accumulate results within the aggregate
    functions, and once to generate the result element.
    If the left array is divided into groups then it'll also separately generate
    aggregate data for each group.
    <p>
    If the left argument is <tt>null</tt> instead of an array,
    then <tt>@</tt> and <tt>@@</tt> return an empty array.
    If the left argument is any other non-array, then it is processed as though it
    was the only element of a 1-element array.
    These two rules are intended to simplify processing of data converted from XML.
    Since XML doesn't have actual arrays,
    XML standards usually simulate it with a repeatable element.
    An empty array in XML is therefore represented by absolutely nothing, and
    a 1-element array is represented by just a plain ol' tag that didn't repeat.
    Stupid XML.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[2,3,5,7,11] @ this &lt; 6</kbd>
	<samp>[2,3,5]</samp>
	Test each element, and keep the ones less than 6.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[2,3,5,7,11] @ {max:max(this), min:min(this)}</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>max</th><th>min</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	<kbd>([2,3,5,7,11] @ {max:max(this), min:min(this)})[0]</kbd>
	<samp>{"max":11,"min":2}</samp>
	Find the maximum and minumum values, and construct an object with their values.
	<a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=max">max()</a> and
	<a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=min">min()</a> are aggregate
	functions, and aggregate functions usually return the same value for all
	items in a group, or in this case for the array as a whole since we aren't
	using groups.
	<p>
	Also since we aren't using groups,
	<tt>@</tt> returns an item for each element of the left array,
	which is why we get an array of five objects back instead of one.
	Arrays of objects are displayed in a grid by default, which is why this doesn't
	look like JSON.
	<p>
	Wrapping the expression in parentheses and adding [0] gets us just one object
        back, which is probably what we wanted.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run") @ {run, max:max(score), min:min(score)}</kbd>
        <samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th>max</th><th>min</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>30</td><td>10</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>35</td><td>25</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>40</td><td>25</td></tr>
	  </table>
        </samp>
        <tt>test.scores</tt> is part of the sample data.
        It is a table (array of objects).
        We use <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=groupBy">groupBy()</a>
        to divide the table into groups, and then use @ to first accumulate
        aggregate data over all elements, and then to return one result element
        per group.
        This gives us a table of statistics about each run.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run","overall") @ {run, max:max(score), min:min(score)}</kbd>
        <samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th>max</th><th>min</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>30</td><td>10</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>35</td><td>25</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>40</td><td>25</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>overall</td><td>40</td><td>10</td></tr>
	  </table>
        </samp>
        The only change between this example and the previous one is,
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=groupBy">groupBy()</a>
        is passed a second argument, causing it to generate an extra element at
        the end of the array for totals.
        This element is the object <tt>{"run":"overall"}</tt>.
        In particular, that added element contains no "score" member so it won't affect
        the aggregate functions.
        Aggregates will be accumulated over each group <em>and for the elements overall</em>,
        and since that <tt>{"run":"overall"}</tt> object isn't part of a group,
        it uses the overall aggregates.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
        <kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run") @@ score &gt;= avg(score) ? {run, name, score, avg(score)}</kbd>
        <samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th>name</th><th>score</th><th>avg(score)</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>Paul</td><td>20</td><td>20</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>Mary</td><td>30</td><td>20</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>Paul</td><td>30</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>Mary</td><td>35</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>Mary</td><td>40</td><td>31.6666666667</td></tr>
	  </table>
        </samp>
        Now we're using <tt>@@</tt> instead of <tt>@</tt> because we want potentially
        one record per element from the left array instead of one per group.
        Details instead of summary.
        This looks for any scores greater than or equal to the average score for
        its run, and returns the element plus the average that it was compared to.
        <p>
        Another interesting thing about this example is, it uses the
        <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=question">?:</a> operator
        but omits the <tt>:</tt> part.
        When you do this, <tt>:null</tt> is implied which is handy in
        <tt>@</tt>/<tt>@@</tt> expressions since <tt>@</tt>/<tt>@@</tt>
        adds nothing to the response for <tt>null</tt>.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Usually you'll want <tt>@</tt>.
            The <tt>@@</tt> operator is only useful when you're comparing individual
            values to aggregate values, and even then only if you're using groups.

	<li>If the left array isn't divided into groups, the <tt>@</tt> will return
	    one element for each left operand element.
	    You might expect it to return just one summary item, but no.
	    It must return one result element per ungrouped left element in order
	    for things like the <tt>groupBy("run","overall")</tt> example above
	    to work.

      </ul>
