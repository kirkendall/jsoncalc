    The <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt> operators compare for equality/inequality.
    They work for strings or numbers. For strings, the comparison is
    case-sensitive.
    <p>
    If you try to compare a string to a number, the
    string will be converted to a number and then the numbers will be compared.
    If the string can't be converted to a number, then the values are considered
    to be unequal.
    <p>
    The <tt>=</tt> and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> operators are the same, but
    case-insensitive.
    <p>
    The <tt>===</tt> and <tt>!==</tt> operators are "strict" in that if the
    operands are of different types, then the are not converted; instead,
    they are considered to be unequal.  These operators differ in another 
    way too: They can be used to compare any types of values, even objects
    or arrays.  Two objects are considered to be equal if they contain the
    same members with the same values; the order in which the members are
    listed doesn't matter.  Two arrays are considered to be equal if they
    have the same length, and the same value at each index.
    String comparison is case-sensitive.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>1 == 1</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
	Yep.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Steve" == "steve"</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
	<kbd>"Steve" = "steve"</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
	<tt>==</tt> is case-sensitive, <tt>=</tt> is not.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{a:1, b:2} === {b:2, a:1}</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
	<kbd>{a:1, b:2} == {b:2, a:1}</kbd>
	<samp>null</samp>
	<tt>===</tt> can compare objects.  The order in which members are
	listed doesn't matter.
	<tt>==</tt> cannot compare objects.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>The <tt>=</tt> and <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> operators are from SQL.
            They are case-insensitive because SQL is case-insensitive.

	<li>The <tt>=</tt> operator is used for comparison in SQL, but assignment
	    in JavaScript.  JsonCalc tries to use it both ways.  This rarely
	    causes confusion though since JsonCalc only allows assignment as
	    a separate statement; you can't sneak an assignment into an
	    expression as you can with JavaScript.  If you do need to force
	    something like "a=b" to be a comparison instead of an assignment,
	    wrap it in parentheses.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>a=b</kbd>
	      <kbd>(a=b)</kbd>
	      <samp>true</samp>
	      The first example assigns the value of <tt>b</tt> to <tt>a</tt>,
	      and returns nothing.
	      The second example compares <tt>a</tt> to <tt>b</tt> and returns
	      <tt>true</tt> because they're equal now.
	    </div>

	<li>The <tt>===</tt> and <tt>!==</tt> operators differ from
	    JavaScript's.  In JavaScript, two objects or arrays are considered
	    to be equal only if they are the same object or array.  In other
	    words, JavaScript compares their memory addresses instead of their
	    contents.
