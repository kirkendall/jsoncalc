    These operators allow you to combine two tables (arrays of objects) into one.
    <p>
    The <tt>#=</tt> "natural join" operator tries to match every object
    in the left operand against every object in the right operand.
    If there are no clashing members (i.e., members with the same name in
    both objects, but with different values), then a new object is added to the result
    with the members from both objects.
    If any shared members' values do clash, then that pairing is rejected.
    The objects in the result array will contain only one copy of the shared
    members.
    <p>
    The <tt>#&lt;</tt> "left natural join" is similar, but if there are any
    objects in the left operand which clash with all objects in the right
    operand, then the object from the left operand is added without any
    changes.
    The result of <tt>#&lt;</tt> is always a superset of <tt>#=</tt> &mdash;
    it's kind of a "natural join plus any leftovers from the left operand".
    <p>
    The <tt>#&gt;</tt> "right natural join" does the same, except it keeps
    unmatched records from the right operand instead.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>[{a:1},{a:2},{a:3}] #= [{b:1},{b:2}]</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>a</th><th>b</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	A simple example to get us started.
	The let operand has only "a" members, and
	the right operand has only "b" members.
	There's no way they could clash, so the result table has all possible
	pairings of objects, and all members from those two objects.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>stores.length</kbd>
	<samp>4</samp>
	<kbd>sales.length</kbd>
	<samp>9</samp>
	<kbd>stores #= sales</kbd>
	<samp>
	<table>
	  <tr><th>store number</th><th>state</th><th>product</th><th>quantity</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>1</td><td>MA</td><td>broiler</td><td>20</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>1</td><td>MA</td><td>socks</td><td>500</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>toaster</td><td>100</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>toaster</td><td>50</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>socks</td><td>10</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>toaster</td><td>50</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>blender</td><td>100</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>blender</td><td>150</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>shirt</td><td>10</td></tr>
	</table>
	</samp>
        This combines the <tt>stores.json</tt> and <tt>sales.json</tt> tables
        to form one big table.  Both tables have a "store number" column, so
        that's used to join the tables &mdash; each result row will combine
        a store row with a sale from that store.  This result table includes
        just 9 rows (instead of the 36 that a full cross-product would return)
        because the other pairings of stores and sales had clashing
        "store number" members.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>stores #&lt; sales</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>store number</th><th>state</th><th>product</th><th>quantity</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>MA</td><td>broiler</td><td>20</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>MA</td><td>socks</td><td>500</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>toaster</td><td>100</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>toaster</td><td>50</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>MA</td><td>socks</td><td>10</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>toaster</td><td>50</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>blender</td><td>100</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>blender</td><td>150</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>CA</td><td>shirt</td><td>10</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>4</td><td>CA</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
        This is identical to the previous example except we used <tt>#&lt;</tt>
        instead of <tt>#=</tt>.  Because of that, the result includes store 4
        even though it has no sales.

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>Cross-product and other "normal" SQL joins aren't supported because
            JSON objects don't allow duplicate member names.
            If we're going to combine rows with shared column names (keys),
            then we can only keep one copy of those columns.
            And for sanity's sake, they'd better have the same value so it
            doesn't matter which one we keep.

        <li>The natural join is somewhat frowned upon by some database designers
            because it depends on information (the column names that are shared)
            that isn't present in the join syntax.
            You have to dig for the column names elsewhere.
            But natural joins are the only kind that make sense when you're
            using JSON objects as rows.
