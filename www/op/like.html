    <h1>LIKE operators</h1>
    <table class="opList">
      <tr><td class="left">string</td><td class="op">LIKE</td><td class="right">pattern<br/>regex</td><td class="opdesc">Test whether a string matches pattern</td></tr>

    </table>
    These compare the left operand (a string) against
    either an SQL pattern (a string with special symbols)
    or a regular expression.
    <p>
    If the right operand is a string, then its characters are compared to the
    left operand as follows:
    <table class="opList">
      <tr><td>_</td><td>The underscore character matches any single character from the left operand.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>%</td><td>The percent sign matches a span of zero or more character from the left operand.  (It's sort of like the * wildcard in filenames.)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>alphabetic characters</td><td>Letters are compared case-insensitively.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Everything else</td><td>All other characters must match exactly.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    If the right operand is a regular expression, then the string is considered
    to match if it contains any text that matches the regular expression.
    If you want to require the whole left operand to match,
    then your regular expression must begin with the ^ metacharacter
    and end with the $ metacharacter.
    The search will be case-sensitive unless you add an <tt>i</tt> flag
    after the regular expression.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Starting to break instead of bend" like "start%end"</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
        This is the "string pattern" variant.
        The "%" matches "ing to break instead of b".
        Also, note that the case difference of the leading "S" is insignificant.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Walla Walla Washington" like /wa.*wa/i</kbd>
	<samp>true</samp>
	This is the "regular expression" variant.
	It matches because the left operand does indeed contain at least two
	instances of "wa".
	The <tt>i</tt> after the regular expression makes it case-insensitive.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>"Walla Walla Washington" like /^wa.*wa$/i</kbd>
	<samp>false</samp>
	This time it does not match, because the <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt>
	metacharacters prevent any extra characters before or after the match.
	The string doesn't <em>end</em> with "wa" so it doesn't match.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li>JsonCalc uses POSIX regular expressions.  They have a somewhat
            different syntax than JavaScript regular expressions.  Probably
            different from SQL too.
