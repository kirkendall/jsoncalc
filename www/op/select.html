    </table>

    The <tt>SELECT</tt> operator is a fairly full-featured version of SQL's SELECT statement.
    The full syntax is...
    <blockquote>
      SELECT DISTINCT <var>columns</var>
      FROM <var>table</var>
      WHERE <var>condition</var>
      GROUP BY <var>columns</var>
      ORDER BY <var>columns</var>
    </blockquote>
    ... but everything except <tt>SELECT</tt> is optional.
    <p>
    The optional <tt>DISTINCT</tt> keyword causes adjacent duplicate records
    to be omitted from the response table.
    <p>
    The optional <var>columns</var> list selects the columns to include.
    It is basically the contents of a <tt>{...}</tt> object generator without
    the curly braces.
    You can use complex expressions to compute new values;
    you aren't limited to just column names.
    You can include alternate names for columns by appending "<tt>AS</tt> <var>key</var>".
    If you omit the <var>columns</var> list, or give just <tt>*</tt> as the list,
    then all columns from the source table are included.
    <p>
    The optional <tt>FROM</tt> <var>table</var> says which table
    (array of objects) to use as the starting point.
    This can be any expression that returns a table,
    even another <tt>SELECT</tt> clause.
    Commas in the <var>table</var> expression will be interpreted as
    "natural join" operations, which elsewhere in <strong>JsonCalc</strong>
    is represented by the <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=join">@=</a> operator.
    If you omit the <tt>FROM</tt> <var>table</var> clause,
    <strong>JsonCalc</strong> will choose a default table as follows:
    <ol>
      <li><tt>this</tt> if it's a table.
      <li>The contents of the current file named on the command line, if it
          contains a table.
      <li>The value of a member if the current file contains an object, and
	  that value is a table.
	  (If multiple members contain tables, <strong>JsonCalc</strong> will use the first.)
    </ol>

    <p>
    The optional <tt>WHERE</tt> <var>condition</var> clause lets you select
    which rows from the source table will be used to construct the result table.
    It should be any boolean expression, and can even use aggregate functions.
    (In SQL, you'd need a separate "HAVING" clause for that.)
    If you omit the <tt>WHERE</tt> <var>condition</var> clause, then all
    rows from the source table are used to generate the result table.
    <p>
    The optional <tt>GROUP BY</tt> <var>columns</var> clause causes the source
    table to be split into segments that share the same values in the listed
    columns. This has two effects.
    First, it directs any aggregate functions such as
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=count">count()</a> or
    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=avg">avg()</a> to generate
    independent results for each group; e.g., <tt>count(*)</tt> would return
    the number of rows in each group, instead of the overall number of rows.
    Second, only one row per group will be included in the result table.
    <p>
    The optional <tt>ORDER BY</tt> <var>fields</var> clause causes rows to
    be sorted by their values in the listed fields.  You may also follow any
    field name in the list with <tt>DESCENDING</tt> or <tt>DESC</tt> to make
    it be sorted in descending order instead of the default ascending order.
    <p>
    One limitation of <tt>GROUP BY</tt> and <tt>ORDER BY</tt> is that
    they can only use elements in the row &mdash; not expressions that derive
    a value from elements.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>SELECT * FROM test.cust</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>name</th><th>contact</th><th>joined</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>Peter</td><td>[table]</td><td>2024-01-02</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Paul</td><td>[table]</td><td>2023-10-15</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Mary</td><td></td><td>2022-08-09</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>Ziggy</td><td>[table]</td><td>2023-04-17</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	This dumps the test.cust table from the sample data.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>SELECT run, avg(score) AS `average score` FROM test.scores GROUP BY run</kbd>
	<samp>
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>run</th><th>average score</th></tr>
	    <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3</td><td>31.6667</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</samp>
	This divides the table.scores table into segments that have the same
	"run" number.  It then generates one row for each group, with the
	run number and computed average score.
      </div>

      <summary>Notes</summary>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>JsonCalc</strong> expressions are case-insensitive.
            Although the examples here give "SELECT" and related words in
            uppercase, you can also write them in lowercase.

	<li><strong>JsonCalc</strong> has several other SQL-like features.  The
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=equal">=, &lt;&gt;</a>,
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=like">LIKE</a>, and
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=between">BETWEEN</a>
	    operators are present, and are case-insensitive as is customary
	    in SQL.  The
	    <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=bool">AND, OR, and NOT</a>
	    operators are there too.
	    The <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?op=in">IN</a> operator
	    is also available, but if the right argument is a list of literals
	    then you must enclose it in JSON-style brackets instead of SQL-style
	    parentheses.

	<li>Internally, <tt>SELECT</tt> expressions are converted to "native"
            functions and operators. An expression such as
            <span style="white-space:nowrap">"<tt>SELECT a AS aprime, b FROM table WHERE d>5 GROUP BY e, f ORDER BY a</tt>"</span>
            would become
            <span style="white-space:nowrap">"<tt>(table.groupBy(["e","f"]) @ d>5 ? {aprime:a, b}).orderBy("aprime")</tt>".</span>

	<li>In the FROM clause, the use of a comma to denote natural join is
	    different from SQL, where it is cross product.  This is mostly
	    because SQL allows joined tables to have columns with the same
	    name but different values, while JSON's objects don't.

	<li>If the SELECT clause's <var>columns</var> list contains complex
	    expressions without an "AS <var>key</var>" to assign it a name,
	    then the expression's source code is used as the default name.
	    You can get some wild-looking keys that way, but they work.

	<li>If every column in the SELECT clause's <var>columns</var> list
	    uses aggregate functions, then there's an implied DISTINCT.
	    <div class="example">
	      <kbd>SELECT count(*) FROM test.scores</kbd>
	      <samp>
		<table>
		  <tr><th>count(*)</th></tr>
		  <tr><td>9</td></tr>
		</table>
		Instead of getting 9 rows that all say "9" for the row count,
		we just get 1 row because of the implied DISTINCT.
	      </samp>
	    </div>
      </ul>
