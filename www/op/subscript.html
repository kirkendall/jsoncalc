    Subscripting is mostly for extracting a single element from an array.
    Usually you'll select the element by supplying its index number.
    Subscript numbers start at 0.
    You can also use negative subscripts to select an element relative to
    the end of the array; for example <tt>arr[-1]</tt> would be the last
    element of array <tt>arr</tt>.
    <p>
    You can also use a number subscript on a string to extract a single
    character from the string, as though the string was an array of characters.
    Basically, "<tt>str[i]</tt>" is the same as
    "<a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?f=substr">str.substr(i,1)</a>".
    You <em>cannot</em> use it on the left of an <a target="_PARENT" href="../index.html?cmd=assign">=</a> assignment operator to change a single letter though.
    <p>
    If the left argument is a table (array of objects), then you can 
    also use the <tt>[</tt><var>key</var><tt>:</tt><var>value</var><tt>]</tt>
    notation to search for the first element containing a member with the
    <var>key</var> and <var>value</var>.
    The <var>value</var> can be any expression; if it is a simple string
    then you must enclose it in quotes.
    <p>
    If the left argument is an object, then you can use subscripting to look
    up the value of a member with a given key.
    This is exactly like <var>object</var><tt>.</tt><var>key</var> notation,
    except that the key can be a computed string.

      <summary>Examples</summary>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>(1..100)[58]</kbd>
	<samp>59</samp>
	<kbd>(1..100)[-2]</kbd>
	<samp>99</samp>
	<tt>(1..100)</tt> is an array of integers from 1 to 100.
	<tt>[58]</tt> finds the 59'th element, since subscript numbers start
	at 0.
	The second statement uses a negative index to find the second-from-last
	element of the array, which has the value <tt>99</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.cust[0].contact[type:"email"]</kbd>
	<samp>{"type":"email","address":"pboy@test.org"}</samp>
	<tt>test.cust</tt> is part of the sample data.
	It is a table in which each row/object can contain a <tt>contact</tt>
	member whose value is a table of contact methods.
	Here we're looking at the first element's <tt>contact</tt> list,
	and selecting the one with <tt>type:"email"</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>test.cust @ contact[type:"email"].address</kbd>
	<samp>["pboy@test.org","notringo@lp.uk"]</samp>
	Across all four customers in <tt>test.cust</tt>,
	we're scanning for a contact method containing <tt>type:"email"</tt>,
	and collecting the corresponding <tt>address</tt> in an array.
	In <tt>test.cust</tt>, one row has no <tt>contact</tt>, and one has
	<tt>contact</tt> but none of its elements contains <tt>type:"email"</tt>.
	The <tt>@</tt> operator filters those out, so we just get the two
	actual email addresses that appear in <tt>test.cust</tt>.
      </div>

      <div class="example">
	<kbd>{aa:1,ab:2}["a"+"a"]</kbd>
	<samp>1</samp>
	Here we're looking up a member's value, using subscripts to provide
	the key.
	This is the same as <tt>{aa:1,ab:2}.aa</tt> except that subscripts allow
	us to compute the key, instead of having it hardcoded in the expression.
      </div>

      <ul>

        <li>Any <tt>[</tt><var>member</var><tt>:</tt><var>value</var><tt>]</tt>
            lookup first tries to find it the member key using a case-sensitive
            search.  If that fails, then a case-insensitive search is tried.

	<li>The use of subscripts on strings is in JavaScript, including the
	    inability to use it in an assignment to change a single character.
