    <h1>Quick Introduction to JsonCalc</h1>
    This document just breezes quickly through the features of the
    <strong>JsonCalc</strong> program.
    It is intended to give you a feel for what it can do, but not explain
    every detail of how it's doing it.
    By the time you reach the end of this document, you should have a good feel
    for whether <strong>JsonCalc</strong> can help you do what you need to do.
    <p>
    Only the <strong>JsonCalc</strong> program and its language are described
    here.
    The library that it uses is a whole other story.

    <h2>Who is JsonCalc for?</h2>
    Me.  I wrote it for me.
    <p>
    I'm a systems programmer who maintains interfaces with a wide variety
    of service providers.
    I dig through a lot of JSON data.
    99.9% of that can be automated, using <strong>JsonCalc</strong> and/or
    its library.
    Sometimes, though, I need to dig through the downloaded data manually,
    and there's a lot of it.
    I need to compare what was downloaded to what ended up in our own database.
    <p>
    I also generate requests to send to the service providers.
    Those tend to be small, real-time requests, in contrast to the downloads
    which are large batch files.
    <p>
    The data that I deal with comes from a service provider's database.
    It's stored in tables there.
    The JSON data may use nested data structures, but there's a strong
    table orientation throughout most of it.
    JsonCalc is good with tables.
    <p>
    Often the data was, at some point, represented in XML.
    It gets converted to JSON but still has some of the stink of XML on it.
    Especially arrays.
    XML doesn't support the concept of arrays, so usually they're represented
    by repeatable elements.
    But this means an empty array is simply gone,
    and a one-element array can become a simple variable.
    Many of JsonCalc's array operators and functions were written with this
    in mind.
    Another XML-ism is that you often get objects inside of objects inside
    of objects.
    There can be good reasons for doing this in any data language, but
    it happens more in XML.
    JsonCalc has a <tt>..</tt> operator which is sort of a "deep search"
    version of the usual <tt>.</tt> operator to help with this.

    <h2>What is JsonCalc like?</h2>
    Syntactically, the main influences are JavaScript and SQL.
    There are some new operators and functions, but mostly its like a
    stripped-down JavaScript with some SQL features added in.
    It supports the most common JavaScript functions and operators.
    <p>
    You can also declare variables, and define functions.
    That can be handy in scripts, but my big motivator was that variables
    and functions can save you some typing when you're using it interactively
    to explore a big dataset.
    <p>
    An expression on a line by itself (no assignment or <tt>return</tt>)
    will output the result of that expression.
    There is no <tt>print</tt> command needed!
    This is great for interactive use.
    It's also sort of like the debugging console in most desktop web browsers.
    <p>
    Here are a few examples just to whet your appetite.
    The bold text is a JsonCalc expression, and the text after it is the result.
    You can click on any bold text to copy it to the clipboard; if you 
    have JsonCalc installed and running on your computer, this makes it easy
    to play with the examples.

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>1 + 2 * 3</kbd>
      <samp>7</samp>
      It makes a decent calculator.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>test.scores</kbd>
      <samp>
	<table>
	  <tr><th>name</th><th>run</th><th>score</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>Peter</td><td>1</td><td>10</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Paul</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Mary</td><td>1</td><td>30</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Peter</td><td>2</td><td>25</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Paul</td><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Mary</td><td>2</td><td>35</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Peter</td><td>3</td><td>30</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Paul</td><td>3</td><td>25</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>Mary</td><td>3</td><td>40</td></tr>
	</table>
      </samp>
      test.scores is a JSON array of objects.
      JsonCalc treats that as a table and, by default, outputs it as a grid.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>SELECT run, avg(score) AS avg FROM test.scores GROUP BY run</kbd>
      <samp>
	<table>
	  <tr><th>run</th><th>avg</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>31.6667</td></tr>
	</table>
      </samp>
      <kbd>(SELECT run, avg(score) AS avg FROM test.scores GROUP BY run).length</kbd>
      <samp>3</samp>
      Looks just a bit like SQL there, doesn't it?
      SELECT is an operator though, and it returns a JSON array of objects.
      So in the second example, we take the length of that array and it's
      simply 3.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>test.scores.groupBy("run") @ {run, avg: avg(score)}</kbd>
      <samp>
	<table>
	  <tr><th>run</th><th>avg</th></tr>
	  <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>2</td><td>30</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>3</td><td>31.6667</td></tr>
	</table>
      </samp>
      Internally, the SELECT operator is converted into a set of "native"
      operators and functions.
      The <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?op=each">@</a> operator
      takes an array as its left operand; processes each element of the
      array via the right operand; and collects the results in a new array.
      <tt>@</tt> also knows about grouping, and accumulates a separate
      <tt>avg(score)</tt> for each group, and then returns only one
      element per group.
      Thus, we end up with an array of 3 objects, where each object has
      members named "run" and "avg".
    </div>

    <p>
    These are just one-liners.  Nothing fancy or too complicated.
    The big takeaway is: JsonCalc expressions are a lot like JavaScript,
    with a bit of SQL and a not-all-that-magical <tt>@</tt> operator.

    <h2>How can JsonCalc help process downloads?</h2>

    JsonCalc is very good at converting JSON data to other formats.
    Those formats could be a different JSON layout (e.g., to convert data
    from different service providers to a single consistent format),
    or CSV or even a series of shell script records.

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>jsoncalc -s sh -c test.scores</kbd>
      <samp>
name=Peter run=1 score=10<br/>
name=Paul run=1 score=20<br/>
name=Mary run=1 score=30<br/>
name=Peter run=2 score=25<br/>
name=Paul run=2 score=30<br/>
name=Mary run=2 score=35<br/>
name=Peter run=3 score=30<br/>
name=Paul run=3 score=25<br/>
name=Mary run=3 score=40
      </samp>
      This is an example of what the shell output looks like, for
      processing data in a shell script.
      Each line of output has one row (one object from an array of objects) in
      a format that looks like shell variable assignments.
      If any of these values required quoting to protect it from the shell,
      such quoting would be automatically added.
      You can also tweak the variable names by adding a <tt>-sprefix="my_"</tt> flag
      to JsonCalc, if necessary.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <kbd>jsoncalc -s sh -c test.scores | while read row<br/>
      do<div style="padding-left: 2em;">
      eval $row<br/>
      echo "$name scored $score in run# $run"
      </div>done</kbd>
      <samp>
	Peter scored 10 in run# 1<br/>
	Paul scored 20 in run# 1<br/>
	Mary scored 30 in run# 1<br/>
	Peter scored 25 in run# 2<br/>
	Paul scored 30 in run# 2<br/>
	Mary scored 35 in run# 2<br/>
	Peter scored 30 in run# 3<br/>
	Paul scored 25 in run# 3<br/>
	Mary scored 40 in run# 3
      </samp>
      This example shows how the command from the previous example could be used
      in a shell script to process records individually.
      The shell reads the lines one at a time into a shell variable named "row".
      It then uses <tt>eval $row</tt> to set shell variables from the record.
      Those variables can then be used any way you want.
    </div>
    <p>
    When looping over large arrays, JsonCalc <em>does not</em> need to load
    the whole array into memory before processing can begin.
    Instead, it parses as much as it can, and notes where the large
    arrays appear in the JSON document, without loading them.
    During processing, as you loop over the array it will read the records
    piecemeal.

    <h2>How can JsonCalc help for uploads?</h2>
    JsonCalc allows you to construct JSON data, either in temporary files or
    in environment variables.
    You can also set JsonCalc variables on its command line, and use the
    values of those variables in the script.

    <div class="example">
      <kbd># These are shell commands, not JsonCalc commands<br/>
      file=/tmp/jsoncalc$$.json<br/>
      echo "{}" &gt;$file<br/>
      jsoncalc -u -c'this.custno=custno' custno=12554 $file<br/>
      jsoncalc -u -c'this.name=first - last' first=Steve last=Kirkendall $file<br/>
      jsoncalc -u -c'this.contactok=contact' contact=false $file<br/>
      cat $file</kbd>
      <samp>{"custno":12554,"name":"Steve Kirkendall","contactok":false}</samp>
      In this example, we're building the JSON data piecemeal in a temporary file.
      First we let the shell choose a filename, and initialize the file to an
      empty object.
      Then we invoke JsonCalc repeatedly to add/update the data.
      The <tt>-u</tt> option tells it to write the data out to the same file
      that it read it from;
      the file name is the last thing on the command line.
      In the end, we're left with a complete JSON object in the
      <tt>$file</tt> file. 
      <p>
      One important detail here is that when setting variables on the
      command line, if the value looks like JSON then it is interpreted as
      JSON; otherwise it it coerced into being a JSON string.
      In this example, <tt>12554</tt> looks like a JSON number, so it's
      number, and <tt>false</tt> looks like a JSON boolean, so its boolean.
      You can see this in the final object.
    </div>

    <h2>Why run JsonCalc interactively?</h2>
    It has lots of little features:
    <ul>
      <li>JsonCalc uses the GNU readline library, to provide line editing,
          history, and name completion.
      <li>Any expression on a line by itself will output its result.
          You don't need to add "print" all the time.
      <li>It is case-insensitive.  When looking up an object member, it first
          tries to find it in a case-sensitive way but if that fails then it
          tries case-insensitive.  This can save you from some frustration.
      <li>In addition to the usual <tt>.</tt> operator, there's a <tt>..</tt>
          operator which will do a "deep" search for a member.
      <li>Arrays of objects ("tables") can be output in multiple formats,
          including a nice grid format.
      <li>There are commands and functions designed specifically for
          interactive data exploration, such as <tt>explain</tt> to describe
          the columns of a table, <tt>find()</tt> to search for a value in a
          large data structure, 
      <li>It has very good support for ISO-8601 dates/times/periods.
          You can do arithmetic on them, convert timezones, and more...
          all of it a lot easier than in JavaScript.
      <li>You can configure it to automatically load JSON data from files
          in a given directory, on demand.
          So if you have a group of related JSON documents, they can all be
          at-hand, and you can cross-reference them all you want.
    </ul>
    It also supports plugins, which is a HUGE feature.
    Most plugins are for things like fetching data from a server,
    but a few are useful for interactive use.
    They can completely replace the user interface.

    <h2>How big is JsonCalc?  How fast is it?</h2>
    JsonCalc is a "medium weight" JSON tool.
    The program itself is about the same size as the
    <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/">jq</a> JSON query tool,
    but about 5 times larger than the
    <a href="https://github.com/jpmens/jo">jo</a> JSON builder tool.
    A full-fledged JavaScript interpreter would be at least 30 times larger
    than JsonCalc, and it wouldn't interface well with shell scripts, or
    support plugins, or autoload data from directories, or have SQL-like
    features or the
    <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?op=each">@</a> operator.
    <p>
    The internal representation of JSON data is likely to be around 5 times
    larger than the JSON text that it comes from.  It could be anywhere from
    2 times larger to more than 10 times larger, but 5 is a good rule of thumb.
    Bear in mind, though, that large arrays aren't normally read into memory
    all at once.  If you process them to build another large array, that
    result array <em>might</em> be in memory so that's where you'd need
    to be aware of bulk.
    <p>
    Speed is hard to gauge because there are so many variables.
    My computer isn't all that new, but
    it can parse a 60 megabyte JSON file in about 300 milliseconds.
    That's fast enough for me.

    <h2>Can JsonCalc be extended?</h2>
    Yes, there are basically three ways to extend JsonCalc.
    <p>
    The easy way is to define a custom set of functions in JsonCalc's
    scripting language, to do tasks that you find yourself doing often.
    For example, the above customer-building example could be implemented
    as a function, and then the "-c" option is just <tt>-c'buildCustomer()'</tt>.
    JsonCalc can be configured to load your functions automatically.
    <p>
    The next method is to modify JsonCalc's source code and recompile it.
    If all you need to do is add a new function, that's fairly easy because
    script functions (defined in <tt>calcfunc.c</tt>) are mostly segregated
    from the rest of the code, so you don't need to learn <em>everything</em>
    about JsonCalc's anatomy to add a function.
    A few basic <tt>json_</tt><var>xxxx</var><tt>()</tt> functions will suffice.
    But all the source code is there if you need it.
    <p>
    The final way is via plugins.
    If an existing plugin satisfies your needs, then that's an easy win.
    If you need to write your own, the plugins included with the source code
    should serve as good examples.
    Technically, each plugin is a shared library which must define an "init"
    function.
    That function will then call JsonCalc C functions to register "hooks" for
    things like autoloading data, adding commands, and... lots of stuff.
    No single thing is all that complicated, but there are a lot of hooks
    to choose from.

    <h2>Where should I look next?</h2>
    Start by digging through the references for the scripting
    <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?lit">literals</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?op">operators</a>,
    <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?f">functions</a>, and
    <a target="_PARENT" href="index.html?cmd">commands</a>.
    The references are loaded with examples, which should give you some idea
    of what JsonCalc can do.
    Nearly all of these examples are one-liners, which is appropriate for
    an interactive data-exploration tool.
    <p>
    More complex things are possible though, so 
    eventually you'll want to go through the
    <a href="index.html?main=tutscript">Scripting Tutorial</a>.
    The tutorial is a lot more instructive if you have JsonCalc installed and
    running on your computer, though, so you should
    <a href="index.html?download">Download JsonCalc</a> first.
    <p>
    If you're looking for a C library of quick and powerful JSON function,
    JsonCalc's library might satisfy.
    There's a
    <a href="index.html?tutlib">library tutorial</a> and
    <a href="index.html?lib">library reference</a> here, to help you get
    started on that.
